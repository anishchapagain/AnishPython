All class work can be completed remotely, your instructor will work with you to ensure that you have the necessary tools and resources. This course will introduce students to the basic forms and terminology of animation, and provide training in fluid representations of motion and expression. Instruction will emphasize traditional character animation techniques such as character development, exaggeration, timing, acting and weight. The course will provide a good grounding for basic animation skills and production processes. The classes will often include film screening from across styles and animation historical contexts to further demonstrate the topics covered in class."

All class work can be completed remotely, your instructor will work with you to ensure that you have the necessary tools and resources.This class is an introduction to basic principles of character animation and expressive form in motion. We&#39;ll begin by looking at great animated sequences for evidence of how to create believable material transformations, actions, or humor in time-based narratives; Goofy&#39;s expressions, Popeye&#39;s distortions, Betty Boop&#39;s walk, or the Coyote&#39;s variety of disintegrations are all represented by motion, distortion, weight, exaggeration, and storytelling. We will focus on these and other traditional character animation principles with smaller weekly assignments via drawings, flip books, acting, storyboards, and quicktime movies generated in Adobe After Effects. Mid and final projects will encourage experimental approaches to animated imagery and presentation of phenomena, including time, abstraction, memory, narrative, or a joke. Since humor is timing and story, jokes will play a significant role in parsing the temporal; and because delivery is often cinematic, film principles will be integrated. We will have guest animators from Pixar and other places to talk about their work and discuss yours. Assignments and projects will involve the use of After Effects, which will be introduced and used to create movies of 2D animations. Photoshop, and digital still and video cameras may be used as well."

This course is designed to teach students how to apply these acting skills to their performance, and is open to those without previous acting experience. Great actors and animators turn internal emotion or thoughts into clear physical actions. Beginning with the theory that all acting is action, students will learn how to create authentic characters, staged in a visual way with movement, weight, timing, and physics. Exploring the uses and benefits of improvisational theater for film and animation, students will explore issues of pacing, conflict, and relationships between characters. They will do in-class physical acting exercises that they can use in their own work, with their own bodies, in ways that will deepen their expression and insights to character."

Our work will operate in a space between imaginative archaeology and speculative design fiction. During the first week, we will explore the spaces of “contact” that define the Bay Area’s environment and through a combination of research and drawing. These realms of contact include moments of connection, hyphenation, and contamination between substances, beings, and topographies from colonization to the recent past. A strong focus of this week will be those residues of indigeneity still detectable within the Bay’s environmental strata. During the second week we will work towards developing our research into more complex reconstructions of sites and geographies and proposals for future spaces in the Bay. Here our points of contact may result in full visualizations of lost worlds or novel interventions and fiction within urban sites or future landscapes. Our final week entails the creation of a giant, collective mural composed of these individual reconstructions, proposals, and speculations. This mural will provide us with a record of our work and serve as a narrative of the Bay Area’s social and environmental tragedies, victories, and future possibilities.David Gissen works at the intersection of architecture, environmental history and experimental design. He is a professor of architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, Austria; professor of architecture at the California College of the Arts, San Francisco; and former visiting professor at Columbia University and MIT. His books include an architectural history of urban environmental degradation, Subnature: Architecture’s Other Environments (2009) and a history of New York City as told through the city’s air, Manhattan Atmospheres (2014). His visual and physical reconstructions of historic landscapes, urban atmospheres and interior environments have been published and exhibited internationally; this includes exhibitions at the 2016 Venice Biennale and the Canadian Centre for Architecture, among other venues. He is the author of numerous texts and studies of architectural and environmental history, architecture theory, and recent work that connects environmental theory to the experience of human impairment. In 2020 he will join the New School University as Professor of Architecture and Urban History.DESIGN EARTH is an architectural research practice led by Rania Ghosn and El Hadi Jazairy.

Carrying its payload for 3 months, the heavy load transport ship Zhen Hua 33 threaded its way along India’s southern tip, the Suez Canal, across the Mediterranean, up the English Channel, and through the Baltic Sea into Stockholm, the final destination for this 3,500 tonne behemoth. The scale of this voyage creates a provocative narrative, one that will forever shape the legacy of this straightforward piece of urban infrastructure. Its appearance from a remote location has captured the public’s imagination: architecture is not built – it arrives as a single object with a story to tell. A_Studio ManifestoThis studio will similarly investigate large-scale opportunities for architecture that can be shipped in its entirety to another location around the world. It will unapologetically present itself as a singular object – a foreigner. Think of it as a superthing – far ranging in its global implications yet legible as a distinct entity. Given our current reliance on shared economies and social contracts in the face of pandemic shutdowns, it is an interesting time to revisit: Are there new opportunities to be discovered at a time we are all thinking about the values of closeness and distance? Rather than focusing on separation, Superthing will explore today’s large-scale transport technologies to propose architecture that is shared, connected, and optimistic: a new aesthetic for our times.B_Site: Transport and LandingIt is required that the building is designed for transport and then maneuvered onto land as a permanent piece of large-scale architecture. Students will research, and most likely invent, off-loading maneuvers to position your superthing into its final location. We’ll privilege “what if” over tried and true logistics. Our ship for transport:Vessel: ZHEN HUA 33 (IMO 9808223, MMSI 414272000)Type: Heavy Load Carrier, built in 2017, currently sailing under the flag of ChinaGross Tonnage: 43,788Carrying Capacity: 50,352 Summer Dead Weight (metric tonnes)Overall Length: 228 metersOverall Width: 43 meters (beam)Our final site location:Located in the upper northern hemisphere far away from our home ‘base’ of CCA/San Francisco. The same site will be assigned to the entire studio. While urban in setting and international in outreach, we will each equally be designing for a site far away. C_Program: Subject &amp; ContentThe programmatic subject for the studio is an urban Co-Work/Maker Space. It’s content – what you will spend most of your time developing – will focus on superthings and architecture designed to move somewhere else. E_Ways of WorkingWe will rely on multi-faceted representational tools to communicate final designs. Emphasis will be placed on sequential scenario drawings to describe architecture on the move. To reinforce our studio culture, students will have the option to form working groups for the semester’s design project: 1 person independent or 2 person teams."

Despite the advances in digital fabrication, there is still a considerable gap between what we can draw and what we can make. At this point, the process of making a complex form is relatively expensive, time-consuming, and more importantly, often wasteful.EMBEDDED INTELLIGENCEThis course is based on the notion of the intelligence embedded in tools and materials. Here, we attempt to establish a design system founded on the intrinsic capabilities embedded in tools that relies upon the inherent properties of materials. This semester, our design strategy is to explore ways to exploit these characteristics in the nested fabrication method.NESTED FABRICATIONThe studio will challenge you to expand your tectonic proficiencies in developing the design principles for nested fabrication. Here, you will explore the main parameters involved in dividing the global geometry of a complex volume into stackable components. By converting different formal, material, and technical restrictions into geometric constraints, the stacked components are divided in a way that the first component gives shape to the second. PROJECTS OVERVIEWIn three interrelated projects, we will explore a zero-waste design system for constructing complex buildings in a nested fashion. In developing this nested fabrication system, we will not only deal with very advanced fabrication techniques (such as robotics), but also consider the transportation, storage, assembly, and even disassembly of building components. Keeping the principles of embedded intelligence and nested fabrication in mind, you will go through the following projects:PROJECT 1: A Fluid Architectural Elemento   Learning the design principles for 2D nested fabrication to use a subtractive method (CNC machining).o   Investigating a method that generates 3D volumes out of a series of 2D pieces, capable of producing almost no waste.o   Using the least number of plywood sheets to design an architectural system for an interior space. PROJECT 2: cityTREE, Salesforce Tower Plaza (San Francisco)o   Exploring the fundamentals of 3D nested construction to create 3D-printed stackable towers (Print in Print).o   Designing a tower as an engineered biome named cityTREE. cityTREE is a platform to address the global problem of air pollution in urban areas, intending to recreate the environmental benefits of an actual tree.o   Learning the basics of robotic 3D printing as an additive method. PROJECT 3: A Transportable Expo Pavilion, EXPO 2023 (Buenos Aires)o   Exploring a nesting technique to establish a form-finding method for tessellating a freeform shell structure into stackable components.o   Designing a transportable expo pavilion that will be fabricated in the US and assembled in Buenos Aires.o   Utilizing both additive/subtractive tools to produce the least possible construction waste. HOW TO LEARN DIGITAL FABRICATION VIA AN ONLINE STUDIOIn this online studio, you will not only learn the way things are made but the way things are programmed to be made. More than just using computer-controlled tools, digital fabrication is a process in which the tools and materials themselves are digital. Therefore, an essential part of this process is to turn data into things and things into data. Making a physical artifact is a step in the long journey of translating a CAD file into a set of commands (G-code) to feed a machine. Consequently, in a digital fabrication lab, approximately 90% of our time is spent on programming the tools to transform digital information into physical products reliably. Through the following approaches, you will enhance your skills and knowledge of making: Weekly reviews Sharing &amp; reviewing similar fabrication processes Exchanging ideas &amp; experience with two robotic labs at Virginia Tech and Texas A&amp;MVirtual simulation of fabrication processesSTUDIO STRUCTUREWe will meet every Monday and Thursday. Based on your time zone, we will schedule synchronous weekly meetings for reviewing the studio projects. If needed, we will have asynchronous classes. You will work individually on Project 1. But in Project 2 &amp;3, you have an option to work independently or in a team of 2 people. As the final deliverable of your projects, you will represent the tectonic characteristics of your designs and the means and methods of their fabrication."

While the Cockettes communed on Scott Street, Janis Joplin resided in an apartment on Ashbury Street just blocks away from the brightly painted purple house where the Grateful Dead spent the Summer of Love (and where the famous drug bust of 1967 took place), and across the bay in Oakland the Black Panthers established their headquarters in a Queen Anne Victorian. In fact, many of the endearing, now “kitsch” architectural qualities held in the popular imagination of the Bay Area are the result of appropriations of counter-cultural expressions of gay and drug culture during a period of social transformations of the 1950s through 1980s. As noted by Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in Painted Ladies: San Francisco’s Resplendent Victorians, “Drugs, media, and the counterculture have made this an age of color. A revulsion against the sterile, inhuman, intimidating monoliths spreading like architectural ooze over the downtown landscape helped foster the need for the enduring stability and character of the Victorians.”5 Ironically, today San Francisco’s Victorian houses are cornerstones of the city’s notoriously conservative preservation policies. What were once domestic symbols of social transformation and cultural influence on the national consciousness of human rights have been aesthetically molded into static representations of what was fundamentally a project in heterogeneity and individual expression.   Step 2: Broaden the Scope:San Francisco’s Queen Anne houses are just one example of how “preservation” policies can reduce culture to a stable, aesthetic image. In so doing, preservation can dilute the legacy - and capacity - for social transformation. If one of the intentions of preservation codes is “to preserve knowledge of the past through architecture”, then one could reasonably expect these codes to illuminate, even to promote, social transformation through changes in cultural and social awareness, generational expressions, individuality, and media. This all begs the question: what is being preserved by preservation policies, and for whom? Planning and preservation commissions routinely regulate architectural styles, forms, materials, uses, etc. under the banner of preservation. In nearly every instance, however, questions arise about what metrics are to be used in assessing the value of cultural heritage in architecture and urban spaces? In fact, the general lack of a theory of preservation among architects leaves a critical aspect of the built environment under the domain of bureaucracies intent on the idea that preservation is an act of stable retrospection.Step 3: Pose an Open-Ended Question:While the avant-garde in art, music, and architecture is typically ambivalent to the affinities of broader culture, could turning our attention to the banal peculiarities found in the everyday lead to alternative sources and understandings for both critiquing preservation and provoking alternative models of it that are both retrospective and projective? Noting that preservation codes generally concentrate on the facade, how might we develop a theory of preservation that is both critical &amp; absurd, applicable &amp; abstract, and dynamic &amp; fleeting?Step 4: Narrow the Content:Each student is asked to interrogate, develop, and deploy terms and techniques of “preservation” by working locally from their respective locations, and by paying attention to facades, public spaces, and architectural elements around them that might not otherwise be seen as a source for architectural investigation, Students will co-create an encyclopedia of under-valued spaces, forms, histories, and places followed by design speculations characterized by the un-ordinary, manipulated, or perverted manifestations of things otherwise considered banal or normal as suggestions for alternative methods of preservation."

The platting and subdivision of land has defined racial and social justice—and exclusion—by shaping the way wealth is created. The Jeffersonian grid, for example, accelerated the colonial settlement of the American West. The single-family home banked on discriminatory loan policies and zoning laws that ban affordable housing in the name of protecting property values. Such systems linger on, preventing Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color from generating wealth. In today’s ‘risk society,’ this legacy leaves precarious communities even more vulnerable to ever-mounting threats of climate change, economic volatility and defunded public health systems. There’s a flip side to property, though. Many of its underlying logics—such as the commons, liability, maintenance, belonging, and yes, even profit—can also be altered towards more inclusive ends. Community Land Trusts, for example, collectivize land while individualizing housing structures. ‘Public Trust’ laws define the public’s right to property by the ever-changing edge between land and water. Such alternate property arrangements can launch deep-seated, systemic reform, prompting social exchange, cultural expression, alternate economies, and ecological vitality. Such arrangements require an entirely different spatial condition, from the scale of the kitchen table to the rooftop to the watershed. In this studio, we will invent new alignments and misalignments across land, foundations, roofs, and furniture. Though property has long assumed a one-to-one correspondence among all of these elements, it is up to designers like you to imagine a far different paradigm. This studio asks how property can be reimagined in the face of crisis to strengthen racial and social justice.The Project: Design one or more buildings in a selected ½-block stretch in West Oakland for the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative (EBPREC).  Define your own program (for example, affordable housing; workers’ cooperatives; artists’ studios; test kitchens; or a community-owned solar array.) Choose your own sites on or near the 7th Street Corridor in West Oakland--a neighborhood that reveals some of the nation’s most progressive visions of racial justice, and some of its most exclusionary politics. Studio Structure and Method: We will alternate between research and design throughout the semester.Research will involve investigations of existing property paradigms, crisis scenarios, and cultural production both in West Oakland and beyond. Students will make analytic diagrams and site maps, and develop unique arguments through visual slide (i.e. powerpoint) narratives. Design will develop through digital models, plans and sections at the building scale, and site plans at the site scale. Our primary final production will focus on a large-scale, lush and playful Graphic Narrative drawings. We will learn from comic books or graphic novels to learn how scenarios can unfold over time within the cultural and social life of West Oakland. Online Format. Students will work individually (or, if they choose, in small teams of 2-3 people), but will also connect to each other through various ‘Pods’, which will change throughout the semester. Pods might, for example, develop common research themes together, pool research findings and site drawings, or offer surprise catalysts for each others’ design explorations. "

With global and national supply chains withering, with air travel interrupted, and with our movement limited to the walk-able world, we are all confined to the Local. But what does Local really mean? How, as architects, might we learn about the potentials of the Local? What makes up the mysterious confluence of factors that result in the thing we call Place? Is it Culture? Climate? Materials? The translation and manipulation of those materials through craft, technique, and technology? The studio seeks to understand these questions.While we live in local environments where these factors have been overrun by globalization, there are places all over the world where this is not the case. Of particulate interest to us, there are vital contemporary architectural practices who operate within a critique of globalization; a wariness of international media, trends, and styles; a disdain for the impacts of “flat world” labor, material supply and environmental impacts; and an exploration of both form and architectural production that is profoundly local in material, construction craft and technique, capacity building, and sustainability (environmental, social, economic and cultural). Often the most inventive and remarkable projects by these practices are located in rural places in Third World countries. The creativity motivated by constrained circumstances and marginal locales has important lessons for us today. This studio proposes to travel to four widely dispersed, and wildly different, places to re-learn about the range of formulations, qualities, and opportunities of the Local.We will be taking advantage of leaving our physical bodies behind to explore locales in India, China, Mexico, and South Africa/Namibia The vehicle for this travel will be your laptop (no passport, visas, or inoculations required). Your lodging: your own bed. Your meals: your own kitchen. The studio materials will include -- along with the usual readings, lectures, tours, and projects -- easy-to-prepare recipes links to music, films and dance, and a wide array of other cultural activities from our chosen locales.This unusual “travel” format also allows us to engage architects from around the world. These visiting faculty will give us studio tours and lectures, and participate in discussions and reviews. So far the invitation list includes: Bijoy Jain (India), Anna Heringer (Germany &#43; Bangladesh), Anupama Kundoo (India), Rahul Merothra (India), Hua Li (China), Liu Jiakun (China), Xiao Deli (China), Wang Shu (China) Lu Wenyu (China), Lee Shu Fan (Hong Kong), Jorge Gracia (Mexico), Elena Tudela (Mexico), Diego Ricalde (Mexico), Raul Cabra (Mexico), Mpethi Morojele (South Africa), Jhono Bennet (South Africa), Mpho Matsipa (South Africa), Jo Noero (South Africa), Nina Maritz (Namibia), Vo Trong Nghia (Vietnam), Brit Andresen (Australia), Glenn Murcutt (Australia) During the studio, each student will keep a collage travel journal using all kinds of materials including: “travel” notes, mappings, hand drawings, a bibliography, collage, reading responses, photos, notes from studio “visits” and lectures, and so on. This journal, along with four portfolio-worthy exploratory drawings (one for each locale), will constitute the output of the studio."

Work focuses around a rigorous semester-long team project that includes development of environmental systems and structural systems and details for a large, complex project.///Biologists define an ecotone as a region of transition between two biological communities. In nature these two communities create edges that are legible but equally capable of growth, adaptation and change.The historical settlement of the San Francisco Bay shoreline, like many urban estuaries, has been one of modifying these natural ecotones in favor of fixed vertical edges engineered for specific hard infrastructures like piers and seawalls. Islais Creek, once the largest watershed in the San Francisco peninsula, was gradually channelized and filled in by real estate speculators. Currently, the location where Islais Creek visually begins (daylighted) is a major outflow for a wastewater treatment plant that handles 80% of the city’s solid waste. The edges are mostly truncated, paved and covered with non-functioning piers and silos, but also commercial shipping that brings in piles of building materials, sand, concrete and aggregate, essential for the construction of the city which rises in the background.These large infrastructural projects have created physical shoreline boundaries, marginalizing communities like Bayview Hunter’s Point from water access and leaving a legacy of polluted soil, underemployment and urban segregation. Yet intertwined with these material staging areas are novel approaches to material salvage, landscape businesses, and creative reuse. We will look to these approaches to suggest potential avenues for new economic development as an alternative to top-down approaches. As historical inequalities are being brought to light in the public discourse and as the economic fallout of the pandemic impacts poor communities disproportionately, this studio will explore how architecture can begin to synthesize ecological and urban remediation with practical and inspired architectural actions.The studio will work with longtime Buoyant Ecologies partners at the Benthic Lab, Kreysler &amp; Associates, and Autodesk Technology Centers. As well as with agency input from the Port of San Francisco, the City of SF Planning as well as BCDC, the major governing bodies tasked with regulating Islais Creek shoreline area. Teams of two will work to understand these high level policies in conjunction with a more fine grain reading of the community, the ecology, and the infrastructure potential of the site. Buoyant Ecologies projects look to infrastructural systems that tap into site resources like wastewater, renewable energy collection, transport hubs, and food production as drivers of a design. Community group liaison as well as ecologists will form equally significant partnerships to reveal and address human and non-human interests to an economic and ecological Center for a neighborhood looking for a transformational relationship to the water’s edge.The studio will also participate in the Green New Deal Superstudio which looks at giving vision to how social justice and climate change can be manifested in specific regional proposals. The studio work will be exhibited as part of this national effort in September of 2021."

With further ecological decline due to the continued extraction of limited resources, an alternative paradigm is necessary if we are to avoid massive global catastrophe. The continued development of forms supporting the current carbon energy flows either hasten their own obsolescence or our own demise. How then can architecture find new postures, organizations, and tectonics that acknowledge a new energy era? While this new paradigm will constitute a novel opportunity to once again renew the patterns of development of our buildings and our cities, we should work toward illuminating pathways that reject carbon-intensive architecture. The studio will encourage the development of solutions that utilize and push the boundaries of mass timber construction in the design of a new museum for San Francisco’s Fort Mason Center. As a point of departure, we will challenge existing typologies and utilize a variety of daylighting techniques as a catalyst for the creation of diverse and dynamic spaces for the experience and protection of art.In this integrated building studio, through iterative prototyping and typological analysis, we will speculate on how a comprehensive approach to building systems can shape the conceptual, formal and experiential nature of the building. Moving beyond the neutrality of the white cube gallery, we will examine the relationship between a work of art, the environment in which it is displayed, and how meaning is conveyed. To this end, we are interested in an approach that encourages a dialogue between artifact, place and an expanding audience.Experiential ArtArt has political consequences, which is to say, it reorganizes society and creates constituencies of people around it.  - Dave HickeyKey to enabling systemic change, expanded constituencies must form around collective ideals and a vision for a shared future. Drawing from the Kramlich Collection, students will be asked to engage with artists from a diverse range of perspectives and backgrounds. This extensive time-based media art collection places “particular emphasis on artists and artworks that create experiences prompting questions and reflection on meaningful aesthetic, ethical, and social issues in our times.” SiteThe site for this new museum for experiential art will be located in the historic Fort Mason Center, an area whose network of piers, warehouses and transportation networks currently serves as an emerging campus for art and culture. While this is a hub of culture and activity, the Fort Mason Center lacks a clear and compelling gateway due to the topography and development of this area. This studio program is designed to enhance the visibility of this place both in content and edifice. Students will be asked to develop building proposals with an urban relationship to the existing buildings and public spaces that give the site its character."

This course will look to the biological underpinnings of coastal infrastructure through material investigations and ecological performance. Currently, concrete, fiberglass or chemically treated wood are primary building materials for their ability to withstand the corrosive effects of salt water. But what if we rethink the degradation of materials as one of the drivers in design? How can materials augment ocean ecology? Do they become habitat for animals? Do they become integrated into the food web? Or do they simply breakdown and dissolve back to molecules?With guidance from design researchers in ecological materials at University of California at Davis, and synthetic biologists at University of California at San Francisco, we will rethink both materials and their fabrication. The work will be twofold. Firstly, the design of components that can be fabricated, deployed and tested in ocean water at one of two AEL (Architectural Ecologies Lab) physical research sites in the San Francisco Bay, and secondly, scaling up these components into speculative proposals which begin to rethink the public relationship between natural and constructed systems. "

Required online synchronous meeting times are listed as the meeting pattern for this course section. We are now in a period of rapid change in the way we design and construct the built environment as the world seeks better models for sustainable development. Research shows that 50% of the climate-change crisis is caused by carbon dioxide released as a result of construction, with the extensive use of high-embodied-energy concrete, steel, and aluminum among the biggest contributors. Modern timber construction is emerging as the only structural option that can radically reduce and sequester CO2, and is a renewable resource when properly harvested. Previous building code limitations on timber construction are being swept away, as advanced technology in fabrication and testing are providing new options for high strength fire-proof use of timber in larger and taller buildings.  This Building Technology seminar will develop tools and resources for applying timber building systems on project types that might conventionally be built of steel or concrete. We will develop drawing , modeling and communication/presentation resources, as well as technical and conceptual skills enabling personalized design processes focused on the making of architecture, with the intent that students can immediately apply them in their current and future design projects. We will discuss timber manufacturing, construction and fabrication processes, and tools, materials and building techniques, within the context of employing these issues as creative considerations within the design process.   The course format will include both synchronous and asynchronous components, with instructor lectures, guest speaker presentations, readings and viewings, case study analyses and hands-on making. Each seminar participant will conduct a semester-long research project on a timber-construction-related topic, and will produce a final document and presentation at the end of the semester. A complementary Integrated Studio offered this semester by the same instructor will focus on mass timber construction, students are welcome to take either or both courses."

Mother nature repeatedly threatens us with natural disasters and continually reminds us that floods, fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and even pandemics are potential and ever present threats to our survival and that of our built environment. Given that the fundamental functions of architecture are to shelter and protect, how can we design structures that not only survive but go beyond to surpass, or possibly bypass or redirect or disrupt, these kinds of extreme natural disasters?In the context of this course, we will explore strategies, technologies, and structural approaches that speculate how we might negotiate such extreme events by leveraging our architectural design skills and our critical problem solving abilities. Our explorations will aim to strike a marriage between architecture, structure, and the colossal demands imposed by these extreme natural phenomena.We will exercise our analytical muscles and aim to sharpen our understanding of architecture in the context of: major environmental demands, structural stability, materials in terms of their strength and mechanics, structural systems, configurations, and sustainability with regards to disaster recovery, shelter, public health, and survival. Students will consider and ultimately design a proposal along with their own adaptive resilient multi-faceted program that addresses the temporal stages from pre-disaster and initial response through immediate recovery and into and beyond long-term rebuilding and regeneration."

From the scale of the body, up through the scale of buildings and cities and on to the scale of the landscape, those with political, cultural, economic and social power exercise explicit and implicit control over the shaping and occupation of space. As architects, it is critical that we understand this physical and spatial manifestation of power relationships. This seminar will explore the ways that power, politics, economics, and social and cultural hierarchies are made physical and will survey and analyze resulting building, public space, urban, and landscape patterns around the globe. Of perhaps greater importance, in this election year, we will also be exploring architectural and urban design tactics, strategies and practices that challenge, subvert or seek to reverse these hierarchies.This seminar will not give you facts, figures or any other sort of empirical knowledge. Instead it will give you a series of new lenses with which to see and, ultimately act in and upon, the physical world around you. Many of the analytical approaches and methods we will be using come from fields such as cultural geography, human geography, cultural anthropology and critical cartography. These fields are terrific at analyzing and critiquing the physical world and human practices in relationship to it. However, while learning critical lessons from these fields, this seminar will move beyond a statement of the issues, no matter how sophisticated. As architects, we are engaged in direct action in the physical world. We search for design solutions. To this end, in this seminar, we will be looking at a wide range of strategies for action in response to the physical issues created by the impression of power upon space."

Required online synchronous meeting times are listed as the meeting pattern for this course section. Practicing Care: Ethics, Labor and Representation is a survey of contemporary conversations on care in art, architecture, culture, and environments. In architecture, understanding ‘care’ as a form of discourse (as well as labor) has little reverberation, despite the fact that architecture has historically and theoretically articulated itself as an art derived from the necessity for shelter – in other words, as an act of care. Theories of care originated in the articulation of gender’s effects on labor, politics, and ethics, but contemporary thinking about care (or theorizing care) has extended to large-scale human and nonhuman processes, including economies, ecologies, and planetary systems. Building upon an expansive definition of care as spanning sites from the bodily and the domestic to interspecies and planetary scales, the course Practicing Care brings together interdisciplinary projects, texts, and conversations from art and architectural practitioners and thinkers whose work centers on processes of breakdown, repair, maintenance, and care-taking. We will examine how organizing and cultural work are also understood to be acts of &#34;caring for,” and conceptualize together how to practice better.

With global and national supply chains withering, with air travel interrupted, and with our movement limited to the walk-able world, we are all confined to the Local. But what does Local really mean? How, as architects, might we learn about the potentials of the Local? What makes up the mysterious confluence of factors that result in the thing we call Place? Is it Culture? Climate? Materials? The translation and manipulation of those materials through craft, technique, and technology? The studio seeks to understand these questions.While we live in local environments where these factors have been overrun by globalization, there are places all over the world where this is not the case. Of particulate interest to us, there are vital contemporary architectural practices who operate within a critique of globalization; a wariness of international media, trends, and styles; a disdain for the impacts of “flat world” labor, material supply and environmental impacts; and an exploration of both form and architectural production that is profoundly local in material, construction craft and technique, capacity building, and sustainability (environmental, social, economic and cultural). Often the most inventive and remarkable projects by these practices are located in rural places in Third World countries. The creativity motivated by constrained circumstances and marginal locales has important lessons for us today. This studio proposes to travel to four widely dispersed, and wildly different, places to re-learn about the range of formulations, qualities, and opportunities of the Local.We will be taking advantage of leaving our physical bodies behind to explore locales in India, China, Mexico, and South Africa/Namibia The vehicle for this travel will be your laptop (no passport, visas, or inoculations required). Your lodging: your own bed. Your meals: your own kitchen. The studio materials will include -- along with the usual readings, lectures, tours, and projects -- easy-to-prepare recipes links to music, films and dance, and a wide array of other cultural activities from our chosen locales.This unusual “travel” format also allows us to engage architects from around the world. These visiting faculty will give us studio tours and lectures, and participate in discussions and reviews. So far the invitation list includes: Bijoy Jain (India), Anna Heringer (Germany &#43; Bangladesh), Anupama Kundoo (India), Rahul Merothra (India), Hua Li (China), Liu Jiakun (China), Xiao Deli (China), Wang Shu (China) Lu Wenyu (China), Lee Shu Fan (Hong Kong), Jorge Gracia (Mexico), Elena Tudela (Mexico), Diego Ricalde (Mexico), Raul Cabra (Mexico), Mpethi Morojele (South Africa), Jhono Bennet (South Africa), Mpho Matsipa (South Africa), Jo Noero (South Africa), Nina Maritz (Namibia), Vo Trong Nghia (Vietnam), Brit Andresen (Australia), Glenn Murcutt (Australia) During the studio, each student will keep a collage travel journal using all kinds of materials including: “travel” notes, mappings, hand drawings, a bibliography, collage, reading responses, photos, notes from studio “visits” and lectures, and so on. This journal, along with four portfolio-worthy exploratory drawings (one for each locale), will constitute the output of the studio."

Phenomenology of Digital Perception (PDP) tackles a new emerging topic in the realm of Virtual Reality and/or Augmented Reality each year. In response to the C-19, the course will pivot away from head mounted displays (HMD) as they are a significant risk factor and instead utilize the expertise from both studying both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications to design and pitch our own augmented reality applications for personal devices. During the semester students will be introduced to Virtual Reality headsets, Mixed Reality headsets, 360 degree cameras, 3d scanning applications, and smartphone/tablet apps. This understanding will supplement the building blocks of the PDP curriculum of learning how video game engines, specifically Unreal and Unity, can influence the perception of physical and digital environments through the examination of interactive spatial software. This work will be conducted alongside a critical reading of the history of gamespaces and the potential of design and artistic workflows to use these elements in innovative ways. Students will begin by creating small interactive games or experiences to understand the capacity of the tools to create engaging experiences. This will be followed by the creation of augmented reality experiences through emerging platforms specific to AR before transitioning into the creation of their own standalone AR applications. The semester will culminate in the development of an AR application pitch targeted for the city itself. In this current age of self- containment, quarantine and isolation, we will use this final assignment as a way to urge our users to venture out into the world and safely explore the city of Oakland with an augmented reality application as their guide. Class meetings may opt to occur offline and on location at the discretion of the students. This project will seek to highlight the contributions of African- American architects, builders, thinkers, leaders and visionaries in the history of the rich landscape of the city of Oakland. The course requires a mobile device and computer capable of running the free UNITY game engine (www.unity3d.com) and the free Unreal Engine 4 (www.unrealengine.com).

Everything else, everything that servessome practical purpose, should be ejected ... “ Adolf Loos, Architecture, 1910.Loos’s observations indicate architecture’s artistic potential is blocked by practicality. Architecture asprogram is not art. A program’s primary function legitimizes, while concealing, ideological routines ofthe status quo. Loos’s statement suggests the ejection of “practical purpose” (i.e. program) returnsarchitecture to the category of art. In other words, uselessness re-orders program fixations and, in turn,confronts pervasive structures and authoritative cultural practices.Contemporary discussions of race, gender, cultural agency, and identity are most vibrant outside ofarchitecture. Discussions of these realities, from within constructed illusions of the “programstatement,” protects institutional dogmas. Recalling to Loos’s idea, displacing the programmatic allowsarchitecture to associate with otherness. Otherness is evolving and complex. The course offers amethodology to explore such complexities while being aware of the limits and potential of architecturaldesign.This seminar/workshop proposes the design of a thing—a Totemic Operator. The thing has a specificpurpose (but not a program). It is closer to art than architecture. Art is an aesthetic surrogate forotherness. The Totemic Operator’s origins are semiological, anthropological, philosophical,technological, and artistic. Its form is the intersection of these disciplines.Formal investigations involving form, materiality, etc. parallel analytical readings of Ferdinand deSaussure, Claude Levi-Strauss, and Martin Heidegger. This technique produces a structured interfacebetween spatial and literary syntaxes. The Totemic Operator, situated between interdisciplinaryperspectives, acquires cultural versatility, substance, and meaning. Architectural design, free ofprogrammatic preoccupations, provides visual/formal order to intersections of discourse. To signifyform as architectonic systems, adjacencies, and intersections re-forms architectural design as anexquisite cultural tool.Online course sections will be delivered with both asynchronous and synchronous components as outlined in the course syllabus.

Engaging this precise question, James Baldwin, in one of his last interviews, and commenting on the work of Toni Morrison, says that Morrison is very “painful” to read precisely because you “recognize the truth” in her work, and the results are “lethal.” In this class, we are going to think together about what might be “lethal” about the practice of the critique of race and culture. Through an engagement with a number of artists of color who think about the politics of culture in their work, we will sit with a series of questions: In what ways does the imagination function as political enunciation? What is the relation between aesthetic form, critique, and practices of liberation? How does thinking critically about race and culture help us to imagine new forms of relationality and social life?"

Why are they ignored? We will investigate some of the ways in which collective—often competing—cultural narratives are formed, reproduced or contested, and circulated. Why have certain stories been accepted as “history” and how have they been contested and challenged to encompass new voices and new meanings? How does art contribute to collective narratives? How can it be used to confront dominant narratives and amplify marginalized voices?

The American Mall is dying, the function of critique is insular, and as more and more people look to their friends rather than art professionals for guidance concerning art and aesthetics.  The failure of chain stores to adapt, and the sluggishness of property owners to realize that radical change in the way we view commerce is necessary is threatening our survival as artists and craftspeople. Emerging fine artists sometimes find it difficult to compete with more established street artists in high traffic festivals and programs.  This course will focus on how to disrupt the capitalist art market, how to navigate the alternative craft and fair markets and how to sell your work directly to the public without professional representation.  Students will learn the underlying issues of power and privilege of the art market, logistics of setting up a booth, applying to juried fairs and doing the research necessary to decide which events or festivals might be a good fit for their work to.  This class will illuminate strategies for students as they transition to the world outside schools such as developing a creating a customer base,  pricing your work, interacting with potential clients and negotiating commissions.  How do our decisions affect who will have access to our work, and what are the various roles of a community artist?  This course examines both conceptual questions, and on the ground retail experience in a number of venues ranging from street markets to shopping malls, and will aid students in the development of the skills set necessary to those who wish to supplement their income through the sale of the Arts and or crafts they have learned to produce at CCA."

It also examines how we exchange knowledge about each of these discourses through popular culture. Through examples from U.S., Western, and global culture, we will study the tremendous influence that popular culture has on our identities, perceptions, values, and everyday lives in the form of music, films, television, print media, and communication technologies. We will investigate questions like: How do the culture industries reinforce racial and sexual domination? How do racially and sexually marginalized groups use popular culture to subvert existing social hierarchies?

Students will conduct hands-on research and create multisensory works combining sound, sight, flavor, scent, and texture. How might we apply a decolonial framework to bridge physical experiences with a sense of place, loss, desire, self, belonging, or resistance?"

As children and young adults, our families and the communities help to shape our identity. However, life experiences allow us to question our identity; and destroy or rebuild both our families and our communities.  This course will explore how identity, family or community is threatened and reconstructed because of a zombie apocalypse. We will explore the resiliency of the human being to redefine themselves for the sole purpose of survival. In conversation with the historical and contemporary world of the Zombie, global philosophy and decolonial theory, we will co-create a template for the survival of the individual, family and in periods of genocide or social unrest, and not just inside of a Hollywood film.  Diversity Studies Seminars are in-depth experiences in the study of multiculturalism and cultural diversity in American society and in societies that have impacted American society.

Upon studying the practice and revolutionary politics of women who not only criticized capitalism but also challenged it, what frameworks of analysis do we gain from them that we can use to make sense of our contemporary moment? What limitations do we still face? Our course will examine historical figures like Harriet Tubman, Ella Baker and Mamie Till who radicalized freedom struggles as much as we will explore the ways critical Black feminist frameworks have been depoliticized within the liberal university settings that produce our newest revolutionaries. We will explore these tensions and contradictions as we work to theorize the dialectical entanglements of race, gender, and capitalism. We will ask ourselves what critical Black feminist thinking means for our collective liberation, and how we can articulate these visions of freedom in what we produce."

Viewed positively, this practice has enriched both textile and fashion design in the West for many centuries, promoted trade and the appreciation of a wide aesthetic range. In the U.S., ethnic-inspired fashion and textiles have been one means by which minorities can express pride in their heritage and hold onto or rejuvenate aspects of the culture immigrants left behind, while allowing others to express sympathy and solidarity with the disenfranchised. As Western fashion has become the everyday norm in many non-Western cultures the preservation of local aspects of design has become ever more important to maintaining cultural identity. Yet there are many negatives. Westernization of fashion in many minorities&#39; home countries was often a result of colonialism and the painful loss of native culture. The adoption of ethnic styles does not guarantee cultural knowledge or sympathy on the part of the creator or the wearer and can underscore social and racial tensions among those who &#34;look different.&#34; Additionally, some disenfranchised communities-Native Americans and African Americans in particular-resent what they see as the commercial exploitation of textiles, imagery, and styles they consider their own and for which they receive no compensation. The course will survey ethnic influences on fashion from several of these perspectives. Class readings and discussion will consider iconic ethnic garments and textiles and ways in which modern fashion&#39;s use of them has had bearing on ethnic identity and Amerian culture. Students will also have the opportunity to examine source materials for and the results of ethnic borrowing in fashion by visiting local museum collections as well as boutiques and department stores and, if possible, the annual Tribal Arts show at Fort Mason."

It can be edgy or virginal, ruinously expensive or cheap. Worn by wealthy aristocrats and royalty of both sexes the length of Europe, for three hundred years lace was a highly fashionable textile artform that graced nearly every article of clothing, accessories, home décor, and more. It was traded for land, cost the modern equivalent of hundreds of thousands, and its manufacture was considered a trade secret. Lace in its most popular form was a luxury commodity whose market and production European kingdoms plotted to dominate. For much of its history, lacemaking was taught as a needlework technique to young aristocratic women at the same time it was taught as a subsistence occupation to labouring boys and girls in poor communities, religious institutions, and workhouses. The transformations wrought by the Consumer revolution, the French Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century combined with technical developments in the nineteenth century altered the lace industry forever by making it more available and more affordable. In this class we will explore the history of lace and the parallels between the ways gender, class, ethnicity, and geographic location influence concepts of value in the past and today.

It also examines how we exchange knowledge about each of these discourses through popular culture. Through examples from U.S., Western, and global culture, we will study the tremendous influence that popular culture has on our identities, perceptions, values, and everyday lives in the form of music, films, television, print media, and communication technologies.

Viewed positively, this practice has enriched both textile and fashion design in the West for many centuries, promoted trade and the appreciation of a wide aesthetic range. In the U.S., ethnic-inspired fashion and textiles have been one means by which minorities can express pride in their heritage and hold onto or rejuvenate aspects of the culture immigrants left behind, while allowing others to express sympathy and solidarity with the disenfranchised. As Western fashion has become the everyday norm in many non-Western cultures the preservation of local aspects of design has become ever more important to maintaining cultural identity. Yet there are many negatives. Westernization of fashion in many minorities&#39; home countries was often a result of colonialism and the painful loss of native culture. The adoption of ethnic styles does not guarantee cultural knowledge or sympathy on the part of the creator or the wearer and can underscore social and racial tensions among those who &#34;look different.&#34; Additionally, some disenfranchised communities-Native Americans and African Americans in particular-resent what they see as the commercial exploitation of textiles, imagery, and styles they consider their own and for which they receive no compensation. The course will survey ethnic influences on fashion from several of these perspectives. Class readings and discussion will consider iconic ethnic garments and textiles and ways in which modern fashion&#39;s use of them has had bearing on ethnic identity and Amerian culture. Students will also have the opportunity to examine source materials for and the results of ethnic borrowing in fashion by visiting local museum collections as well as boutiques and department stores and, if possible, the annual Tribal Arts show at Fort Mason."

It can be edgy or virginal, ruinously expensive or cheap. Worn by wealthy aristocrats and royalty of both sexes the length of Europe, for three hundred years lace was a highly fashionable textile artform that graced nearly every article of clothing, accessories, home décor, and more. It was traded for land, cost the modern equivalent of hundreds of thousands, and its manufacture was considered a trade secret. Lace in its most popular form was a luxury commodity whose market and production European kingdoms plotted to dominate. For much of its history, lacemaking was taught as a needlework technique to young aristocratic women at the same time it was taught as a subsistence occupation to labouring boys and girls in poor communities, religious institutions, and workhouses. The transformations wrought by the Consumer revolution, the French Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century combined with technical developments in the nineteenth century altered the lace industry forever by making it more available and more affordable.

Who defines it and what implications does it have on the development of culture and personal narrative? How have indigenous cultures been portrayed in western art history? Are contemporary films more or less sensitive to the treatment of native peoples than they have been in the past? In this class we will survey the treatment of indigenous cultures from around the world with a specific interest in the tribes and peoples of the Americas as it relates to the formation of our national identity. in this class attention will be paid to how international myths and stories inform our perception of cultures outside the U.S. We will examine the way indigenous tribes of northern Europe are portrayed in documentary as well as fantasy films and reflect on the adoption and appropriation of prehistoric myths and plot lines as they are exploited in contemporary film and literature. Simply, we will reflect upon what it means to be “from” somewhere and how that informs our decisions and ideas about making art and art history."

With global and national supply chains withering, with air travel interrupted, and with our movement limited to the walk-able world, we are all confined to the Local. But what does Local really mean? How, as architects, might we learn about the potentials of the Local? What makes up the mysterious confluence of factors that result in the thing we call Place? Is it Culture? Climate? Materials? The translation and manipulation of those materials through craft, technique, and technology? The studio seeks to understand these questions.While we live in local environments where these factors have been overrun by globalization, there are places all over the world where this is not the case. Of particulate interest to us, there are vital contemporary architectural practices who operate within a critique of globalization; a wariness of international media, trends, and styles; a disdain for the impacts of “flat world” labor, material supply and environmental impacts; and an exploration of both form and architectural production that is profoundly local in material, construction craft and technique, capacity building, and sustainability (environmental, social, economic and cultural). Often the most inventive and remarkable projects by these practices are located in rural places in Third World countries. The creativity motivated by constrained circumstances and marginal locales has important lessons for us today. This studio proposes to travel to four widely dispersed, and wildly different, places to re-learn about the range of formulations, qualities, and opportunities of the Local.We will be taking advantage of leaving our physical bodies behind to explore locales in India, China, Mexico, and South Africa/Namibia The vehicle for this travel will be your laptop (no passport, visas, or inoculations required). Your lodging: your own bed. Your meals: your own kitchen. The studio materials will include -- along with the usual readings, lectures, tours, and projects -- easy-to-prepare recipes links to music, films and dance, and a wide array of other cultural activities from our chosen locales.This unusual “travel” format also allows us to engage architects from around the world. These visiting faculty will give us studio tours and lectures, and participate in discussions and reviews. So far the invitation list includes: Bijoy Jain (India), Anna Heringer (Germany &#43; Bangladesh), Anupama Kundoo (India), Rahul Merothra (India), Hua Li (China), Liu Jiakun (China), Xiao Deli (China), Wang Shu (China) Lu Wenyu (China), Lee Shu Fan (Hong Kong), Jorge Gracia (Mexico), Elena Tudela (Mexico), Diego Ricalde (Mexico), Raul Cabra (Mexico), Mpethi Morojele (South Africa), Jhono Bennet (South Africa), Mpho Matsipa (South Africa), Jo Noero (South Africa), Nina Maritz (Namibia), Vo Trong Nghia (Vietnam), Brit Andresen (Australia), Glenn Murcutt (Australia)During the studio, each student will keep a collage travel journal using all kinds of materials including: “travel” notes, mappings, hand drawings, a bibliography, collage, reading responses, photos, notes from studio “visits” and lectures, and so on.

What limitations do we still face? Our course will examine historical figures like Harriet Tubman, Ella Baker and Mamie Till who radicalized freedom struggles as much as we will explore the ways critical Black feminist frameworks have been depoliticized within the liberal university settings that produce our newest revolutionaries. We will explore these tensions and contradictions as we work to theorize the dialectical entanglements of race, gender, and capitalism.

How are our habits of both looking and making conditioned by norms of ableism and associated qualities including “skill,” “stamina,” “beauty” and “criticality”? We will explore deep intersections between disability justice and social struggles in the areas of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality and class; as well as urgent issues of the environment, labor, and poverty. For help engaging these themes, we’ll delve into practices of artists and designers, who take them on with passion, humor, irony and radical imagination from within the lived experience of disability. Underlying our work this semester is a challenge raised by disabled artists and cultural workers to understand disability not simply as a form of living to be accommodated by normative, so-called abled-bodied society, but an embodied form of knowledge offering unique insights into the vast diversity of body-minds inhabiting the world, including our own. "

Departing from non-Western ideas of art as ritual and as an essential component of community life, the main goal of this class is to grasp the concept of collective performance practices and to reconcile the differences in &#34;others&#34; through deep understanding of the &#34;self.&#34; The class is specifically designed for both, art students who already perform in a public setting and also for those who want to overcome their stage fright and have want to find a new venue of expression. This class will culminate with a performance in a public space. Taught by Guillermo Galindo performer/composer founder and curator of POW! Action Art Festival, San Francisco."
COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-35065,Spring 2021,Undergraduate,Diversity Studies,TBD,DIVST-3000-18 : Mural Project,,Online,Studio,Tue 10:00-11:55AM,3,15,0,Open,2021-01-25,2021-05-09,,"This Mural class approaches the college website as a virtual campus composed of virtual public walls and/or public sites, that the mural class will develop with a collaborative virtual mural. The overarching theme of the virtual mural is “what responsibilities individuals have toward their community.” As the college begins to reopen during the pandemic -- developing hybrid classes, opening student residencies, shops, etc., students, faculty, and staff take responsible daily actions on the campus like social distancing, regularly washing hands, and wearing masks. However, there are also individual behaviors that each person can take while off campus that can increase or decrease the risk to the on-campus community. Students in the Mural Art class will analyze and weigh these concerns to visually express how individual choices impact others, especially those that form the CCA learning community, “our team of 2,200,”* to adapt Prime Minister Jacinda Arden’s phrase when referring to New Zealand. The course would work with campus partners to support efforts already underway to build a healthy and proactive campus culture in response to the ongoing pandemic that could foster community norms, and also help orient prospective and incoming students, or anyone interested in the art school. Mural students would interview other students, faculty, administrators, staff, in order to design from a foundation that represents a good cross section of the college. The class would work with website staff to produce a practical and interactive addition to the website."

You will take a deep dive into these patterns, and come to understand them by playing with them, varying them, and adapting them. You will even use some of the very mechanisms life itself uses to make your own patterns. In the second part of the course you will use living organisms to create novel patterns and textiles. You will work with these organisms to create something never before seen. These bio-patterns will then be deployed to create a form, textile or garment. The mode of deployment will be based on the mode of life of the organisms you have collaborated with.Having built your skills, in the third part of the course you will set off on an independent path to create a unique piece that is evolved from living constituents, with an innovative work of design/fashion created with life itself. The course culminates with projects being submitted to the CCA Fashion BioDesign Challenge 2021.  (Last year&#39;s winners hailed from three different departments: Camila Wandemberg, Individualized; Claire Mermelstein, Fashion and Giovanna Spilman, Industrial Design.)  And the winner of that challenge will go on to the global BioDesign Challenge 2021, and present in NYC in the summer of 2021.  See link for more details: https://biodesignchallenge.org/"

What does it mean to create and enter an immersive environment as a spectator or a participant? What are the differences and similarities of these related systems? As we try to define some of these catchall (yet to be defined) varied immersive 360, spherical and Virtual Reality environments, we will experiment and create our own works. As these new technologies emerge becoming increasingly more accepted, the tools, systems and workflow required to create these works, are also transforming. Discussions will include historical and current context, ethical and aesthetic concerns. With a film media-based emphasis, we will experiment and explore new platforms and tools currently available to artists. We will work collaboratively and individually to create immersive video/film environments using these new forms of media to engage and envelope a viewer. "

These realms of contact include moments of connection, hyphenation, and contamination between substances, beings, and topographies from colonization to the recent past. A strong focus of this week will be those residues of indigeneity still detectable within the Bay’s environmental strata. During the second week we will work towards developing our research into more complex reconstructions of sites and geographies and proposals for future spaces in the Bay. Here our points of contact may result in full visualizations of lost worlds or novel interventions and fiction within urban sites or future landscapes. Our final week entails the creation of a giant, collective mural composed of these individual reconstructions, proposals, and speculations. This mural will provide us with a record of our work and serve as a narrative of the Bay Area’s social and environmental tragedies, victories, and future possibilities.DESIGN EARTH is an architectural research practice led by Rania Ghosn and El Hadi Jazairy.

Carrying its payload for 3 months, the heavy load transport ship Zhen Hua 33 threaded its way along India’s southern tip, the Suez Canal, across the Mediterranean, up the English Channel, and through the Baltic Sea into Stockholm, the final destination for this 3,500 tonne behemoth. The scale of this voyage creates a provocative narrative, one that will forever shape the legacy of this straightforward piece of urban infrastructure. Its appearance from a remote location has captured the public’s imagination: architecture is not built – it arrives as a single object with a story to tell. A_Studio ManifestoThis studio will similarly investigate large-scale opportunities for architecture that can be shipped in its entirety to another location around the world. It will unapologetically present itself as a singular object – a foreigner. Think of it as a superthing – far ranging in its global implications yet legible as a distinct entity. Given our current reliance on shared economies and social contracts in the face of pandemic shutdowns, it is an interesting time to revisit: Are there new opportunities to be discovered at a time we are all thinking about the values of closeness and distance? Rather than focusing on separation, Superthing will explore today’s large-scale transport technologies to propose architecture that is shared, connected, and optimistic: a new aesthetic for our times.B_Site: Transport and LandingIt is required that the building is designed for transport and then maneuvered onto land as a permanent piece of large-scale architecture. Students will research, and most likely invent, off-loading maneuvers to position your superthing into its final location. We’ll privilege “what if” over tried and true logistics. Our ship for transport:Vessel: ZHEN HUA 33 (IMO 9808223, MMSI 414272000)Type: Heavy Load Carrier, built in 2017, currently sailing under the flag of ChinaGross Tonnage: 43,788Carrying Capacity: 50,352 Summer Dead Weight (metric tonnes)Overall Length: 228 metersOverall Width: 43 meters (beam)Our final site location:Located in the upper northern hemisphere far away from our home ‘base’ of CCA/San Francisco. The same site will be assigned to the entire studio. While urban in setting and international in outreach, we will each equally be designing for a site far away. C_Program: Subject &amp; ContentThe programmatic subject for the studio is an urban Co-Work/Maker Space. It’s content – what you will spend most of your time developing – will focus on superthings and architecture designed to move somewhere else. E_Ways of WorkingWe will rely on multi-faceted representational tools to communicate final designs. Emphasis will be placed on sequential scenario drawings to describe architecture on the move. To reinforce our studio culture, students will have the option to form working groups for the semester’s design project: 1 person independent or 2 person teams."

Despite the advances in digital fabrication, there is still a considerable gap between what we can draw and what we can make. At this point, the process of making a complex form is relatively expensive, time-consuming, and more importantly, often wasteful.EMBEDDED INTELLIGENCEThis course is based on the notion of the intelligence embedded in tools and materials. Here, we attempt to establish a design system founded on the intrinsic capabilities embedded in tools that relies upon the inherent properties of materials. This semester, our design strategy is to explore ways to exploit these characteristics in the nested fabrication method.NESTED FABRICATIONThe studio will challenge you to expand your tectonic proficiencies in developing the design principles for nested fabrication. Here, you will explore the main parameters involved in dividing the global geometry of a complex volume into stackable components. By converting different formal, material, and technical restrictions into geometric constraints, the stacked components are divided in a way that the first component gives shape to the second. PROJECTS OVERVIEWIn three interrelated projects, we will explore a zero-waste design system for constructing complex buildings in a nested fashion. In developing this nested fabrication system, we will not only deal with very advanced fabrication techniques (such as robotics), but also consider the transportation, storage, assembly, and even disassembly of building components. Keeping the principles of embedded intelligence and nested fabrication in mind, you will go through the following projects:PROJECT 1: A Fluid Architectural Elemento   Learning the design principles for 2D nested fabrication to use a subtractive method (CNC machining).o   Investigating a method that generates 3D volumes out of a series of 2D pieces, capable of producing almost no waste.o   Using the least number of plywood sheets to design an architectural system for an interior space. PROJECT 2: cityTREE, Salesforce Tower Plaza (San Francisco)o   Exploring the fundamentals of 3D nested construction to create 3D-printed stackable towers (Print in Print).o   Designing a tower as an engineered biome named cityTREE. cityTREE is a platform to address the global problem of air pollution in urban areas, intending to recreate the environmental benefits of an actual tree.o   Learning the basics of robotic 3D printing as an additive method. PROJECT 3: A Transportable Expo Pavilion, EXPO 2023 (Buenos Aires)o   Exploring a nesting technique to establish a form-finding method for tessellating a freeform shell structure into stackable components.o   Designing a transportable expo pavilion that will be fabricated in the US and assembled in Buenos Aires.o   Utilizing both additive/subtractive tools to produce the least possible construction waste. HOW TO LEARN DIGITAL FABRICATION VIA AN ONLINE STUDIOIn this online studio, you will not only learn the way things are made but the way things are programmed to be made. More than just using computer-controlled tools, digital fabrication is a process in which the tools and materials themselves are digital. Therefore, an essential part of this process is to turn data into things and things into data. Making a physical artifact is a step in the long journey of translating a CAD file into a set of commands (G-code) to feed a machine. Consequently, in a digital fabrication lab, approximately 90% of our time is spent on programming the tools to transform digital information into physical products reliably. Through the following approaches, you will enhance your skills and knowledge of making: Weekly reviews Sharing &amp; reviewing similar fabrication processes Exchanging ideas &amp; experience with two robotic labs at Virginia Tech and Texas A&amp;MVirtual simulation of fabrication processesSTUDIO STRUCTUREWe will meet every Monday and Thursday. Based on your time zone, we will schedule synchronous weekly meetings for reviewing the studio projects. If needed, we will have asynchronous classes. You will work individually on Project 1. But in Project 2 &amp;3, you have an option to work independently or in a team of 2 people. As the final deliverable of your projects, you will represent the tectonic characteristics of your designs and the means and methods of their fabrication."

COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-33411,Fall 2020,Graduate,Graduate Architecture,TBD,MARCH-6070-4 : Advanced Studio: Situation Normal...All F’d Up - or - SNAFU,Clark M Thenhaus,Online,Studio,"Mon/Thu 12:30-06:30PM, Online - AR-7",6,12,0,Open,2020-09-02,2020-12-15,ARCHT-5070-4: Advanced Studio: Situation Normal...All F’d Up - or - SNAFU,"Step 1: Give an Anecdote:       During the late 1950s through the early 1980s Victorian houses in the San Francisco Bay Area were, unlike today, cheap to rent and often occupied by younger, progressive, counter-culture populations. While the Cockettes communed on Scott Street, Janis Joplin resided in an apartment on Ashbury Street just blocks away from the brightly painted purple house where the Grateful Dead spent the Summer of Love (and where the famous drug bust of 1967 took place), and across the bay in Oakland the Black Panthers established their headquarters in a Queen Anne Victorian. In fact, many of the endearing, now “kitsch” architectural qualities held in the popular imagination of the Bay Area are the result of appropriations of counter-cultural expressions of gay and drug culture during a period of social transformations of the 1950s through 1980s. As noted by Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in Painted Ladies: San Francisco’s Resplendent Victorians, “Drugs, media, and the counterculture have made this an age of color. A revulsion against the sterile, inhuman, intimidating monoliths spreading like architectural ooze over the downtown landscape helped foster the need for the enduring stability and character of the Victorians.”5 Ironically, today San Francisco’s Victorian houses are cornerstones of the city’s notoriously conservative preservation policies. What were once domestic symbols of social transformation and cultural influence on the national consciousness of human rights have been aesthetically molded into static representations of what was fundamentally a project in heterogeneity and individual expression.   Step 2: Broaden the Scope:San Francisco’s Queen Anne houses are just one example of how “preservation” policies can reduce culture to a stable, aesthetic image. In so doing, preservation can dilute the legacy - and capacity - for social transformation. If one of the intentions of preservation codes is “to preserve knowledge of the past through architecture”, then one could reasonably expect these codes to illuminate, even to promote, social transformation through changes in cultural and social awareness, generational expressions, individuality, and media. This all begs the question: what is being preserved by preservation policies, and for whom? Planning and preservation commissions routinely regulate architectural styles, forms, materials, uses, etc. under the banner of preservation. In nearly every instance, however, questions arise about what metrics are to be used in assessing the value of cultural heritage in architecture and urban spaces? In fact, the general lack of a theory of preservation among architects leaves a critical aspect of the built environment under the domain of bureaucracies intent on the idea that preservation is an act of stable retrospection.Step 3: Pose an Open-Ended Question:While the avant-garde in art, music, and architecture is typically ambivalent to the affinities of broader culture, could turning our attention to the banal peculiarities found in the everyday lead to alternative sources and understandings for both critiquing preservation and provoking alternative models of it that are both retrospective and projective? Noting that preservation codes generally concentrate on the facade, how might we develop a theory of preservation that is both critical &amp; absurd, applicable &amp; abstract, and dynamic &amp; fleeting?Step 4: Narrow the Content:Each student is asked to interrogate, develop, and deploy terms and techniques of “preservation” by working locally from their respective locations, and by paying attention to facades, public spaces, and architectural elements around them that might not otherwise be seen as a source for architectural investigation, Students will co-create an encyclopedia of under-valued spaces, forms, histories, and places followed by design speculations characterized by the un-ordinary, manipulated, or perverted manifestations of things otherwise considered banal or normal as suggestions for alternative methods of preservation."
COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-33470,Fall 2020,Graduate,Graduate Architecture,TBD,MARCH-6070-5 : Advanced Studio: Property in Crisis,Janette Kim,Online,Studio,"Mon/Thu 12:30-06:30PM, Online - AR-8",6,12,5,Open,2020-09-02,2020-12-15,ARCHT-5070-5: Advanced Studio: UR: Property in Crisis,"Property is power. The platting and subdivision of land has defined racial and social justice—and exclusion—by shaping the way wealth is created. The Jeffersonian grid, for example, accelerated the colonial settlement of the American West. The single-family home banked on discriminatory loan policies and zoning laws that ban affordable housing in the name of protecting property values. Such systems linger on, preventing Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color from generating wealth. In today’s ‘risk society,’ this legacy leaves precarious communities even more vulnerable to ever-mounting threats of climate change, economic volatility and defunded public health systems. There’s a flip side to property, though. Many of its underlying logics—such as the commons, liability, maintenance, belonging, and yes, even profit—can also be altered towards more inclusive ends. Community Land Trusts, for example, collectivize land while individualizing housing structures. ‘Public Trust’ laws define the public’s right to property by the ever-changing edge between land and water. Such alternate property arrangements can launch deep-seated, systemic reform, prompting social exchange, cultural expression, alternate economies, and ecological vitality. Such arrangements require an entirely different spatial condition, from the scale of the kitchen table to the rooftop to the watershed. In this studio, we will invent new alignments and misalignments across land, foundations, roofs, and furniture. Though property has long assumed a one-to-one correspondence among all of these elements, it is up to designers like you to imagine a far different paradigm. This studio asks how property can be reimagined in the face of crisis to strengthen racial and social justice.The Project: Design one or more buildings in a selected ½-block stretch in West Oakland for the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative (EBPREC).  Define your own program (for example, affordable housing; workers’ cooperatives; artists’ studios; test kitchens; or a community-owned solar array.) Choose your own sites on or near the 7th Street Corridor in West Oakland--a neighborhood that reveals some of the nation’s most progressive visions of racial justice, and some of its most exclusionary politics. Studio Structure and Method: We will alternate between research and design throughout the semester.Research will involve investigations of existing property paradigms, crisis scenarios, and cultural production both in West Oakland and beyond. Students will make analytic diagrams and site maps, and develop unique arguments through visual slide (i.e. powerpoint) narratives. Design will develop through digital models, plans and sections at the building scale, and site plans at the site scale. Our primary final production will focus on a large-scale, lush and playful Graphic Narrative drawings. We will learn from comic books or graphic novels to learn how scenarios can unfold over time within the cultural and social life of West Oakland. Online Format. Students will work individually (or, if they choose, in small teams of 2-3 people), but will also connect to each other through various ‘Pods’, which will change throughout the semester. Pods might, for example, develop common research themes together, pool research findings and site drawings, or offer surprise catalysts for each others’ design explorations. "

In nature these two communities create edges that are legible but equally capable of growth, adaptation and change.The historical settlement of the San Francisco Bay shoreline, like many urban estuaries, has been one of modifying these natural ecotones in favor of fixed vertical edges engineered for specific hard infrastructures like piers and seawalls. Islais Creek, once the largest watershed in the San Francisco peninsula, was gradually channelized and filled in by real estate speculators. Currently, the location where Islais Creek visually begins (daylighted) is a major outflow for a wastewater treatment plant that handles 80% of the city’s solid waste. The edges are mostly truncated, paved and covered with non-functioning piers and silos, but also commercial shipping that brings in piles of building materials, sand, concrete and aggregate, essential for the construction of the city which rises in the background.These large infrastructural projects have created physical shoreline boundaries, marginalizing communities like Bayview Hunter’s Point from water access and leaving a legacy of polluted soil, underemployment and urban segregation. Yet intertwined with these material staging areas are novel approaches to material salvage, landscape businesses, and creative reuse. We will look to these approaches to suggest potential avenues for new economic development as an alternative to top-down approaches. As historical inequalities are being brought to light in the public discourse and as the economic fallout of the pandemic impacts poor communities disproportionately, this studio will explore how architecture can begin to synthesize ecological and urban remediation with practical and inspired architectural actions.The studio will work with longtime Buoyant Ecologies partners at the Benthic Lab, Kreysler &amp; Associates, and Autodesk Technology Centers. As well as with agency input from the Port of San Francisco, the City of SF Planning as well as BCDC, the major governing bodies tasked with regulating Islais Creek shoreline area. Teams of two will work to understand these high level policies in conjunction with a more fine grain reading of the community, the ecology, and the infrastructure potential of the site. Buoyant Ecologies projects look to infrastructural systems that tap into site resources like wastewater, renewable energy collection, transport hubs, and food production as drivers of a design. Community group liaison as well as ecologists will form equally significant partnerships to reveal and address human and non-human interests to an economic and ecological Center for a neighborhood looking for a transformational relationship to the water’s edge.The studio will also participate in the Green New Deal Superstudio which looks at giving vision to how social justice and climate change can be manifested in specific regional proposals.

With further ecological decline due to the continued extraction of limited resources, an alternative paradigm is necessary if we are to avoid massive global catastrophe. The continued development of forms supporting the current carbon energy flows either hasten their own obsolescence or our own demise. How then can architecture find new postures, organizations, and tectonics that acknowledge a new energy era? While this new paradigm will constitute a novel opportunity to once again renew the patterns of development of our buildings and our cities, we should work toward illuminating pathways that reject carbon-intensive architecture. The studio will encourage the development of solutions that utilize and push the boundaries of mass timber construction in the design of a new museum for San Francisco’s Fort Mason Center. As a point of departure, we will challenge existing typologies and utilize a variety of daylighting techniques as a catalyst for the creation of diverse and dynamic spaces for the experience and protection of art.In this integrated building studio, through iterative prototyping and typological analysis, we will speculate on how a comprehensive approach to building systems can shape the conceptual, formal and experiential nature of the building. Moving beyond the neutrality of the white cube gallery, we will examine the relationship between a work of art, the environment in which it is displayed, and how meaning is conveyed. To this end, we are interested in an approach that encourages a dialogue between artifact, place and an expanding audience.Experiential ArtArt has political consequences, which is to say, it reorganizes society and creates constituencies of people around it.  - Dave HickeyKey to enabling systemic change, expanded constituencies must form around collective ideals and a vision for a shared future. Drawing from the Kramlich Collection, students will be asked to engage with artists from a diverse range of perspectives and backgrounds. This extensive time-based media art collection places “particular emphasis on artists and artworks that create experiences prompting questions and reflection on meaningful aesthetic, ethical, and social issues in our times.” SiteThe site for this new museum for experiential art will be located in the historic Fort Mason Center, an area whose network of piers, warehouses and transportation networks currently serves as an emerging campus for art and culture. While this is a hub of culture and activity, the Fort Mason Center lacks a clear and compelling gateway due to the topography and development of this area. This studio program is designed to enhance the visibility of this place both in content and edifice. Students will be asked to develop building proposals with an urban relationship to the existing buildings and public spaces that give the site its character."

With global and national supply chains withering, with air travel interrupted, and with our movement limited to the walk-able world, we are all confined to the Local. But what does Local really mean? How, as architects, might we learn about the potentials of the Local? What makes up the mysterious confluence of factors that result in the thing we call Place? Is it Culture? Climate? Materials? The translation and manipulation of those materials through craft, technique, and technology? The studio seeks to understand these questions.While we live in local environments where these factors have been overrun by globalization, there are places all over the world where this is not the case. Of particulate interest to us, there are vital contemporary architectural practices who operate within a critique of globalization; a wariness of international media, trends, and styles; a disdain for the impacts of “flat world” labor, material supply and environmental impacts; and an exploration of both form and architectural production that is profoundly local in material, construction craft and technique, capacity building, and sustainability (environmental, social, economic and cultural). Often the most inventive and remarkable projects by these practices are located in rural places in Third World countries. The creativity motivated by constrained circumstances and marginal locales has important lessons for us today. This studio proposes to travel to four widely dispersed, and wildly different, places to re-learn about the range of formulations, qualities, and opportunities of the Local.We will be taking advantage of leaving our physical bodies behind to explore locales in India, China, Mexico, and South Africa/Namibia The vehicle for this travel will be your laptop (no passport, visas, or inoculations required). Your lodging: your own bed. Your meals: your own kitchen. The studio materials will include -- along with the usual readings, lectures, tours, and projects -- easy-to-prepare recipes links to music, films and dance, and a wide array of other cultural activities from our chosen locales.This unusual “travel” format also allows us to engage architects from around the world. These visiting faculty will give us studio tours and lectures, and participate in discussions and reviews. So far the invitation list includes: Bijoy Jain (India), Anna Heringer (Germany &#43; Bangladesh), Anupama Kundoo (India), Rahul Merothra (India), Hua Li (China), Liu Jiakun (China), Xiao Deli (China), Wang Shu (China) Lu Wenyu (China), Lee Shu Fan (Hong Kong), Jorge Gracia (Mexico), Elena Tudela (Mexico), Diego Ricalde (Mexico), Raul Cabra (Mexico), Mpethi Morojele (South Africa), Jhono Bennet (South Africa), Mpho Matsipa (South Africa), Jo Noero (South Africa), Nina Maritz (Namibia), Vo Trong Nghia (Vietnam), Brit Andresen (Australia), Glenn Murcutt (Australia) During the studio, each student will keep a collage travel journal using all kinds of materials including: “travel” notes, mappings, hand drawings, a bibliography, collage, reading responses, photos, notes from studio “visits” and lectures, and so on. This journal, along with four portfolio-worthy exploratory drawings (one for each locale), will constitute the output of the studio."

Required online synchronous meeting times are listed as the meeting pattern for this course section. We are now in a period of rapid change in the way we design and construct the built environment as the world seeks better models for sustainable development. Research shows that 50% of the climate-change crisis is caused by carbon dioxide released as a result of construction, with the extensive use of high-embodied-energy concrete, steel, and aluminum among the biggest contributors. Modern timber construction is emerging as the only structural option that can radically reduce and sequester CO2, and is a renewable resource when properly harvested. Previous building code limitations on timber construction are being swept away, as advanced technology in fabrication and testing are providing new options for high strength fire-proof use of timber in larger and taller buildings.  This Building Technology seminar will develop tools and resources for applying timber building systems on project types that might conventionally be built of steel or concrete. We will develop drawing , modeling and communication/presentation resources, as well as technical and conceptual skills enabling personalized design processes focused on the making of architecture, with the intent that students can immediately apply them in their current and future design projects. We will discuss timber manufacturing, construction and fabrication processes, and tools, materials and building techniques, within the context of employing these issues as creative considerations within the design process.   The course format will include both synchronous and asynchronous components, with instructor lectures, guest speaker presentations, readings and viewings, case study analyses and hands-on making. Each seminar participant will conduct a semester-long research project on a timber-construction-related topic, and will produce a final document and presentation at the end of the semester. A complementary Integrated Studio offered this semester by the same instructor will focus on mass timber construction, students are welcome to take either or both courses."

Currently, concrete, fiberglass or chemically treated wood are primary building materials for their ability to withstand the corrosive effects of salt water. But what if we rethink the degradation of materials as one of the drivers in design? How can materials augment ocean ecology? Do they become habitat for animals? Do they become integrated into the food web? Or do they simply breakdown and dissolve back to molecules?With guidance from design researchers in ecological materials at University of California at Davis, and synthetic biologists at University of California at San Francisco, we will rethink both materials and their fabrication. The work will be twofold. Firstly, the design of components that can be fabricated, deployed and tested in ocean water at one of two AEL (Architectural Ecologies Lab) physical research sites in the San Francisco Bay, and secondly, scaling up these components into speculative proposals which begin to rethink the public relationship between natural and constructed systems."

Our explorations will aim to strike a marriage between architecture, structure, and the colossal demands imposed by these extreme natural phenomena.We will exercise our analytical muscles and aim to sharpen our understanding of architecture in the context of: major environmental demands, structural stability, materials in terms of their strength and mechanics, structural systems, configurations, and sustainability with regards to disaster recovery, shelter, public health, and survival. Students will consider and ultimately design a proposal along with their own adaptive resilient multi-faceted program that addresses the temporal stages from pre-disaster and initial response through immediate recovery and into and beyond long-term rebuilding and regeneration.Online course sections will be delivered with both asynchronous and synchronous components as outlined in the course syllabus.

Students will learn to understand and analyze daylight and electric light as a highly-integrated series of systems that depend on climate, material properties and geometry, glazing, shading, the eye’s biology, and the brain’s sensory perception of surface and space. A series of phased design exercises will guide the class’ explorations of luminous space and allow students to experiment with the complex interdependencies among architectural form, light, and human visual perception. The course will move quickly through the fundamentals such as surface brightness and contrast to advanced concepts such as Daylight Autonomy and building automation. Prospective simulation and retrospective measurement and documentation will form the means to analyze and verify both quantitative and qualitative performance. Along the way, students will examine the role that light plays in occupant health, comfort, and delight as well as building energy consumption.Prerequisite: Architecture Studio 1 or equivalent as well as proficiency in Rhinoceros and Grasshopper."

From the scale of the body, up through the scale of buildings and cities and on to the scale of the landscape, those with political, cultural, economic and social power exercise explicit and implicit control over the shaping and occupation of space. As architects, it is critical that we understand this physical and spatial manifestation of power relationships. This seminar will explore the ways that power, politics, economics, and social and cultural hierarchies are made physical and will survey and analyze resulting building, public space, urban, and landscape patterns around the globe. Of perhaps greater importance, in this election year, we will also be exploring architectural and urban design tactics, strategies and practices that challenge, subvert or seek to reverse these hierarchies.This seminar will not give you facts, figures or any other sort of empirical knowledge. Instead it will give you a series of new lenses with which to see and, ultimately act in and upon, the physical world around you. Many of the analytical approaches and methods we will be using come from fields such as cultural geography, human geography, cultural anthropology and critical cartography. These fields are terrific at analyzing and critiquing the physical world and human practices in relationship to it. However, while learning critical lessons from these fields, this seminar will move beyond a statement of the issues, no matter how sophisticated. As architects, we are engaged in direct action in the physical world. We search for design solutions. To this end, in this seminar, we will be looking at a wide range of strategies for action in response to the physical issues created by the impression of power upon space."

Everything else, everything that servessome practical purpose, should be ejected ... “ Adolf Loos, Architecture, 1910.Loos’s observations indicate architecture’s artistic potential is blocked by practicality. Architecture asprogram is not art. A program’s primary function legitimizes, while concealing, ideological routines ofthe status quo. Loos’s statement suggests the ejection of “practical purpose” (i.e. program) returnsarchitecture to the category of art. In other words, uselessness re-orders program fixations and, in turn,confronts pervasive structures and authoritative cultural practices.Contemporary discussions of race, gender, cultural agency, and identity are most vibrant outside ofarchitecture. Discussions of these realities, from within constructed illusions of the “programstatement,” protects institutional dogmas. Recalling to Loos’s idea, displacing the programmatic allowsarchitecture to associate with otherness. Otherness is evolving and complex. The course offers amethodology to explore such complexities while being aware of the limits and potential of architecturaldesign.This seminar/workshop proposes the design of a thing—a Totemic Operator. The thing has a specificpurpose (but not a program). It is closer to art than architecture. Art is an aesthetic surrogate forotherness. The Totemic Operator’s origins are semiological, anthropological, philosophical,technological, and artistic. Its form is the intersection of these disciplines.Formal investigations involving form, materiality, etc. parallel analytical readings of Ferdinand deSaussure, Claude Levi-Strauss, and Martin Heidegger. This technique produces a structured interfacebetween spatial and literary syntaxes. The Totemic Operator, situated between interdisciplinaryperspectives, acquires cultural versatility, substance, and meaning. Architectural design, free ofprogrammatic preoccupations, provides visual/formal order to intersections of discourse. To signifyform as architectonic systems, adjacencies, and intersections re-forms architectural design as anexquisite cultural tool.Online course sections will be delivered with both asynchronous and synchronous components as outlined in the course syllabus.

More specifically, this course will critically investigate the terms of legibility and representation in architecture through historical and formal analyses, contemporary design techniques, and methods of integration into practice. We can begin by saying that legibility in architecture requires both visual clarity of a building’s appearance such that its formal, spatial, and material compositions can be comprehended, as well as a certain clarity of its social, cultural, and political histories. While the term legibility carries a connotation of conclusiveness or objective qualifications, legibility in the context of architecture is most often inconclusive and unresolved. We can also say, or perhaps debate, that representation is at the core of what architects do, and therefore we must go beyond the understanding of representation as merely the production of drawings, models, and renderings for the purposes of depicting your idea. Thus, the interrelations between legibility and representation are crucial to forming a critical practice of engaged architecture, yet they are fraught with ambiguity; ambiguity that is ripe with critical and creative possibilities in architectural history, theory, and design. This course will primarily consist of faculty led lectures and discussions, complimented by some readings, videos, short student presentations, and the production of a series of images and/or models. Less of a note-taking class and more of a routinized, weekly social encounter, the primary, mandatory, unwavering prerequisite is that each student must come prepared to actively engage in discourse, debate, and dialogue – And must also carry this ethos over to your other classes and divisional culture at CCA.  "

We will focus on four themes and spend three weeks on each to unpack its historic contexts and counter-narratives. “Property” looks at the way land has been parceled and commodified—from the Jeffersonian Grid to what Rem Koolhaas has called the culture of congestion. “Equity” explores systems of racial and class discrimination, from red-lining to gentrification. “Ecology” assesses urbanism’s attitude towards environment across theories of the Garden City movement, sustainability and climate risk. Lastly, “Economy” examines the distribution of wealth and resources by real estate development, Neoliberal planning, labor and work. Urban Imaginaries is ½ seminar and ½ workshop. In seminar sessions, students will write short responses to medium-sized readings and contribute to class discussion. In workshop sessions, students will make one presentation on a contemporary case study related to one of the themes, and then develop their findings to create a collective book cataloging related architectural and urban design strategies.

Sparked by a loss of confidence in the state as steward of these resources and the free market as provider of goods and services, today’s interest in the commons is rooted in their promise of collective governance, alternative ownership models and equal distribution of spatial and material resources. This seminar will reflect on the constituent components of the commons (a resource; users of this resource; and the practice of negotiating and governing this use) across its historical, contemporary, and utopian forms. Through theoretical texts and projects, we will consider commoning practices across three types of territories: spaces of production (agriculture &#43; manufacturing), spaces of reproduction (domestic environments), and spaces of recreation (parks &#43; public space). Rather than idealizing terms like ‘community’ and ‘sharing’ as popularized by tech giants like Facebook and Airbnb, we will probe commons projects for their latent negotiations of boundaries and exclusion, and their processes of space appropriation and self-organization – reflecting on the role of architectural expertise in commoning practices.Framing the Commons combines a seminar and workshop format. In the seminar component, students will write reading responses and contribute to discussions and debates. In the workshop component, students will produce analytical drawings of commons projects as part of a collectively assembled commons ‘cookbook’ that aims to link analysis with speculative strategies for changing ownership and resource distribution in cities today. "

While recent crises have put telecommunications (especially streaming video) into sharp focus, multimedia interactions have long been an important part of our social lives. Things change, though. Phone calls largely gave way to texting and videoconferencing. Person-to-person videoconferencing expanded to multiparty soirées. Hybrid content has blended the synchronous and asynchronous.  Talking heads become empowered by virtual shared surfaces and objects.  Mundane screens get replaced by VR and AR environments for work and play. Sound and sight remain as incumbent modalities for virtual presence, but other senses are being blended in…touch, smell, and even taste.  These communication channels have become a critical part of our lives, for work and play, for learning and social exchanges, with colleagues, family, and friends.  This course will combine critique of what currently exists with imagining distant futures, fixing current problems, and simulating near futures to shine a spotlight on the myriad ways we can be our social selves while being physically distant. It’s not all about technology, either….much of what we&#39;ll explore involves using storytelling to convey compelling scenarios. We may do some simple coding, author a few web pages, mock-up some interactions, and create some envisionment videos, but students won’t need particular skills in these areas to excel in the class."

From the tool-making early humans to the Indo-European *magh(“power, force, capacity,”) to the performative and conceptual mechane of ancient Greek theater, and the Latin ex-machina, to ancient China’s mechanical inventions, the magic and fetishistic allure of the machine seem to have accompanied the human experiment from its very beginnings. But what has made the “machine” a powerful signifier of modernity has been its widespread reach, as it became inextricable integrated to the development of capitalism and colonialism, both as a “thing-commodity,” and as worldview that accorded to the logocentrism of the European Enlightenment and the new mechanistic sciences. The grafting of emotion, digital connectivity, and AI machine learning onto the industrial, financial and consumer apparatus of neoliberal modernity has resulted in the exponential acceleration of a machinic regime of debt and desire, where design, image simulacra, and algorithmic dividualityhave played a crucial role. This regime has contributed to a “social subjection” and “machinic enslavement” that has fragmented the commons into isolated and commodified selves. – The topic studio will review elements of this history. We will study the ambiguous legacy of Bauhaus. We will revisit assorted science fiction films, representing this passage to a machine economy, further reviewing specific elements of emotional capitalism design strategies that accelerate the commodification of the public sphere into ever more manipulated social media and monopolistic global digital platforms, unpacking some of the political, economic, psychological, ecological, technological, cultural, and design solutions implicit in this process, to finally aim at imagining Other Worlds, other designs, beyond the One-World vision of neoliberal modernity."

What do we owe the dead? How do we pay tribute? We’ll look at a variety of cultural artifacts, including obituaries, photos, film, webcasts, poetry, memoirs, diaries, performance, sculpture, graves. One touchstone will be Bob Flanagan, for whom the trauma of cystic fibrosis opened up new realms of sexual expression. Year after year, Flanagan was the oldest living person with cystic fibrosis, and some have suggested that the intensity of Flanagan’s art practice is what kept him alive. We’ll consider a range of artists and writers whose work confronts death and terminal illness, and how death has affected the careers of various artists. We’ll look at AIDS-inspired art, recent as well as historical examples. We will pay particular attention to social media’s impact on private and group mourning. How has it redefined the divide between public and nonpublic figures? Does death on social media make everyone a bit famous? We’ll consider work that suggests a sort of sexiness to illness and death—as well as work that shocks us out of sentimentality. How does our collective mourning for diminishing environmental and social safety nets impact our personal mourning? The class will include a field trip to the Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma. Flexibility will be built into the class in order to respond to student interests and projects.----Theory courses are designed to hone students&#39; critical skills through intensive reading and writing assignments.

Both in service to and in spite of our sexual desires, how do we orient, embody, and/or materialize queer objects? How do we reconcile these often contingent orientations with a larger need to create community? At a time when individual signs are without signifiers, how can we navigate our ambivalence between preserving historic codes of sexual difference and the urgency to abandon them in favor of new, often diaphanous modes of speaking? Through various visual and theoretical examples, we will examine historic and contemporary sensibilities by which objects, images and spaces are queered. Archetypal structures surrounding performativity, confession, nostalgia, criminality, ornamentation, abstraction, and the death drive, will be examined as we complicate our quest to locate and reconstruct critical new forms of desire. ---Theory courses are designed to hone students&#39; critical skills through intensive reading and writing assignments.

A supple agility and promiscuous curiosity will be supported through a series of mind- and practice-bending researches inside the confines of the artist&#39;s current work. With an eye on the Futurescope, as well as to the multiple personalities that exist within all of us, a set of lenses, prisms, and algorithms will be mapped onto and into the artist&#39;s studio procedures to see what the shape of things to come could be, as well as what the shape of things that already are could become. In short, artists will be asked to enter The Anti-Closing Down Machine. The entrance of the Anti-Closing Down Machine is a hall of mirrors equipped with sliding floors, beyond which the artist encounters a wobbly, reconfigurable environment that extends both within themselves and without. This is the region where there lurk moveable holes that can be grabbed and repositioned. It is the realm of Borges&#39; Library of Babel, where Richard Artschwager&#39;s blips are equivalent to the U.S. Constitution and the Communist Manifesto; the Rubber Universe within which life and death may or may not take place.

We examine the role of art objects to initiate movement and for bodies to be informed by materials and contexts. Situated in the social and political – participation, engagement, agency and mobility will be examined in consideration of positionality and structural formations. Our work will bridge political and historical concerns of labor, audience, gaze, power, vulnerability, attention and passivity as we consider and enact performativity in body, language and forms.

As a result, whether we intend to or not, our creations impact our customers, audiences, and users in ways usually not acknowledged or addressed by traditional product development or strategy. There are, at least, six dimensions of experience:• Intensity• Breadth• Duration• Interaction• Triggers• ValueThis represents an opportunity for better performing and more pleasing designs and solutions than what has come before. In addition, this model crosses all design disciplines (graphic/visual/communications, packaging, industrial/product, fashion, interior, automotive/transportation, media strategy, architecture, etc.), and seeks to create integrative and holistic solutions that create premium value for their audiences, users, customers, and participants.Experience design also creates value among several levels of relationship (whether customer-company, customer-brand, customer-product/service offering or even person-person):• Meaningful• Identity• Emotional• Financial• EconomicThis course orients students to the full spectrum of human experience dimensions as well as the five major senses. It introduces tools to better understand and create more meaningful solutions. The course is organized around projects to encapsulate and stimulate learning through exploring, prototyping, researching, observing and evaluatingDesign processes and techniques will be studied in readings as well as put into practice in projects throughout the course. Students will be required to present articulate design concepts verbally as well as visually at a professional level in an open class critique format.

It offers an opportunity for students to engage in these conversations, while gaining the ability to use theoretical resources in their own work. Much of our course will be devoted to learning the languages of critical analysis and determining how theory intersects with the visual and critical arenas. The course is by design interdisciplinary, drawing upon the theoretical advances made in fields as diverse as philosophy, linguistics, art history, psychoanalysis, and literary studies. Given the abstract nature of our readings, one of our challenges will be to determine how, if at all, these texts actually facilitate a discussion of the visual. The guiding thesis of this course is that the visual is situated within larger fields of cultural production, which require carefully defined strategies to make explicit their ontological, epistemological, historical, and political assumptions. Strategies for Visual &amp; Critical Studies will help students acquire certain essential skills. It will outfit students with methods of critical analysis while enabling them to refine their written and verbal communication skills. It will help students to develop an ethical perspective on contemporary visual culture and thereby deepen visual literacy.

Students investigate how theorists and artists address the complex intersections of race, sexuality, gender, class, health, and nationality in light of subjects such as immigration, transnational media, diasporic communities, disidentification, belonging, and desire. Special attention is given to critical and visual perspectives that challenge monolithic views of identity. Instead we privilege diverse, multiple, and intersectional approaches that connect lived experience, social critique, and artistic practice. This course focuses on cultural diversity, critical analysis, and visual literacy. Students also sharpen their research, verbal communication, and writing skills.

In the first part of the course you will explore the pattern-generating mechanisms that create much of what is commonly referred to as natural beauty. You will take a deep dive into these patterns, and come to understand them by playing with them, varying them, and adapting them. You will even use some of the very mechanisms life itself uses to make your own patterns. In the second part of the course you will use living organisms to create novel patterns and textiles. You will work with these organisms to create something never before seen. These bio-patterns will then be deployed to create a form, textile or garment. The mode of deployment will be based on the mode of life of the organisms you have collaborated with.Having built your skills, in the third part of the course you will set off on an independent path to create a unique piece that is evolved from living constituents, with an innovative work of design/fashion created with life itself. The course culminates with projects being submitted to the CCA Fashion BioDesign Challenge 2021.  (Last year&#39;s winners hailed from three different departments: Camila Wandemberg, Individualized; Claire Mermelstein, Fashion and Giovanna Spilman, Industrial Design.)  And the winner of that challenge will go on to the global BioDesign Challenge 2021, and present in NYC in the summer of 2021.  See link for more details: https://biodesignchallenge.org/"

We will focus first on the external industry landscape as we study the competitive and resource factors that contribute to the creation and capture of value.  Internally, we will learn business concepts related to how modern companies hire and employ resources to optimize their  success. Related is the topic of social good and what the public demands of companies to add social responsibility components to their companies.   These core areas known as business (internal) and corporate (external) strategy will provide students a sharpened picture of where they see themselves initially participating and thriving within the work environment.   Designers have the unique ability to open entrepreneurial businesses either as an aspirational career or as a  “side hustle” to their regular job.  Entrepreneurship from idea to a viable business will be explored.  Touching on innovation, user experience research, legal/accounting topics will be learned and put into simulated businesses as part of the class.   Lastly, we complete the goals for this course by creating the development of a unique professional persona.  Topics such as leadership, deep communication, collaboration and external media presence will be explored.  Though we cannot replace the internship experience, we can offer exposure to the practice of strategy that will provide insight and business skills as students prepare to join the design workforce or strike out on their own.  I warmly welcome you to this inaugural course!"

This class focuses on image making that is oriented primarily to the areas of the decorative arts, i.e. product design, packaging design, apparel, the home decor industry, and other decorative and design-driven uses.Class projects will be structured around the types of assignments you might be tasked with in your future career. With this in mind, I am delighted to see students who push the boundaries in terms of concept and execution and produce work that is far outside the commercial norm. I relish your ingenuity and ability to surprise me. So please explore and have fun. I encourage you to take risks and learn from the happy accidents!Unlike other illustration courses, we will be making products that detour from traditional 2-dimensional artwork. However, given the constraints of remote-learning, you’ll be fulfilling assignments that will require you to first design, then use photoshop or some other digital means, to simulate three dimensional products. This requires the student to consider scale. The work produced in this class will be created with an eye towards creating a professionally oriented portfolio.Please email trose2&#64;cca.edu if you have any questions about this course!"

It has been variously described as the future of virtual and augmented reality; the 3D internet; and an online universe in which we will spend ever increasing amounts of time working, collaborating &amp; playing. One of the earliest examples of a  metaverse was Second Life, a 3D social network that is still going strong after a decade. Facebook Horizon is a more recent attempt at building a VR social metaverse. Gaming is an area where metaverses have gained traction with examples like Fortnite, Roblox and Minecraft. While major questions remain about exactly what form the Metaverse will take, what is certain is that it is coming and fast -- brought on by technical advancements and the way in which human behavior has undergone seismic shifts in the shadow of a global pandemic.Design will play a critical role in figuring out every dimension of the Metaverse: design research to establish need and validate experiences; the architecture and design of the virtual spaces that manifest it; visual &amp; interaction design for the core immersive experience as well as critical support services such as matchmaking &amp; onboarding; the creative content that will drive consumer engagement; design of headsets and input devices that make it accessible; and finally the ethical foundations and behavior design that underpin these new online cultures. Achieving the full potential and positive outcome from a metaverse will require close collaboration between the different design disciplines."

Interaction design wasn’t invented from scratch or developed as a self-contained practice. Our practice emerged out of the intersection and integration of a number of disciplines from within design (graphic design, industrial design, game design), social sciences (anthropology, psychology, human factors), but also from printing &amp; communication, architecture, computer science and beyond. There are many different definitions of what it is and through the History of Interaction Design course, students explore key moments along some of these disciplines that have come together to make this field. This course highlights key figures, well known and lesser known, as well as key moments in time that are major points of change and integration of practices. Students are asked to seek out underrepresented and marginalized voices that are often left out of the mainstream history books and to consider how designers, artists and authors envision the future of interaction through analysis of past design work, exploring technology through science fiction and speculative futures design. Through readings, videos, and their own writings, students explore their own perceptions of these moments and begin developing their own unique voice as an interaction designer placed within this interesting and dynamic lineage."

We will focus first on the external industry landscape as we study the competitive and resource factors that contribute to the creation and capture of value.  Internally, we will learn business concepts related to how modern companies hire and employ resources to optimize their  success. Related is the topic of social good and what the public demands of companies to add social responsibility components to their companies.   These core areas known as business (internal) and corporate (external) strategy will provide students a sharpened picture of where they see themselves initially participating and thriving within the work environment.  Designers have the unique ability to open entrepreneurial businesses either as an aspirational career or as a  “side hustle” to their regular job.  Entrepreneurship from idea to a viable business will be explored.  Touching on innovation, user experience research, legal/accounting topics will be learned and put into simulated businesses as part of the class.  Lastly, we complete the goals for this course by creating the development of a unique professional persona.  Topics such as leadership, deep communication, collaboration and external media presence will be explored.  Though we cannot replace the internship experience, we can offer exposure to the practice of strategy that will provide insight and business skills as students prepare to join the design workforce or strike out on their own.  I warmly welcome you to this inaugural course!"

In order to do this, we must be able to take a broad, systemic view; we must also master the details of specific interactions. Students will explore this space over the course of the semester, following the arc of a typical service design project and working in small teams, reflecting our actual professional practice.Section Description:In this course we will address the growing epidemic of loneliness. The output of this class are prototyped services which cultivate authentic, embodied connections that can provide moments of contentment and potentially alleviate loneliness. We will consider the antidote to social isolation as meaningful, embodied connections which range from brief interactions to sustained and enduring relationships. These genuine, reciprocal experiences can occur at any scale, from the intimate and personal to the collective and communal. The primary emphasis of your service will be to support meaningful face-to-face moments, activities and exchanges where participants feel a sense of belonging and/or purpose. Digital technology will play a supporting role and be in service of these person-to-person experiences.Through collaborative practices and reflection, we will sensitize ourselves to the suffering which arises from this subjective feeling of social isolation. Because of the social distancing arising from current covid-19 pandemic , we are all feeling this to some degree or another. This is an excellent moment to be mindful of how isolation feels and how social disconnection influences both our sense of loneliness and our need for genuine, direct connection. In preparation for this class, you are strongly encouraged to keep track of this time in any way that helps you feel your way into the topic. "

We&#39;ll begin our course by listening to Samoan, Chamorro, and Hawaiian poets; we’ll close with tales of Pele, goddess of fire and volcanoes, and Kamapua’a—a being who could appear as a hog or as a human—from the Hawaiian creation story, The Kumulipo. In between, we’ll read the contemporary novel Melal by Robert Barclay, set in the Marshall Islands. Through critical readings in Lewis Hyde’s Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art, we&#39;ll learn why eternal trickster figures like Kamapua’a in Hawaii or Etao in the Marshall Islands remain essential to the literature and lives of Pacific peoples. Select contextual readings and viewings will focus on the ongoing legacy of colonialism and atomic testing in the Pacific; the art and science of navigation known as Wayfinding; builders of islands—the tiny coral polyp and the fierce volcano; and orature, the oral art that has carried myths and legends for thousands of years, at once preserving cultures, and entertaining and educating listeners, ourselves among them."

Questions of gender, race, class, and sexuality are “abjected” through monsters, Gothic locations, and mysteries lurking in the shadows. But how do writers and artists harness “the strongest emotion of which the mind is capable”? In this course we will read and view examples from folklore to experimental horror to explore how to build tension in a narrative, when (and when not) to break it, and what to do with the bloody mess that’s leftover. Assignments will range from analytical and creative writing to other visual and auditory narrative mediums."

It is a basic organizing principle of culture and functions most overtly in its smallest unit, the family. Why? would be a suitable question for a sociology course; as artists, we will ask How? are social class and class issues portrayed in literature and film. How are the rich and the poor perceived by themselves and one another? How has narrative art dealt with the relationship between class, race, and gender? Is class the great equalizer? In what ways has literature depicted success and failure at upward mobility? What is the role of the “middle” class in narrative art? Texts may include works by Kathryn Boo, Anton Chekhov, Evan Connell, Theodore Dreiser, E.M.

Reviewers and polemicists are often at the vanguard of artistic movements, championing individual artists and challenging the status quo over what is considered great or worthless. For a large part of the general public, the review is the first and most significant point of contact with any artist or artistic field. Some of the most important moments in arts criticism have been when artists write about other artists. Sometimes, they write about their own field, but other times poets have written about painting, painters about films, architects about fashion, designers about music, sculptures about novels and so on. In this class, you will learn to master the four basic forms of arts journalism: the short and long review, the artist profile, the interview and the manifesto. You&#39;ll model your writing after other writers and see how easy it is to churn out one-to-three page reviews and articles on work that you love or hate. We will then publish what you write in an online review, the CCA Art Review. The goal of the class is to give you the opportunity to speak your mind in public and to get your writing and thinking out of the classroom and in front of a general readership. In addition to your writing, we will learn how to get free tickets, use press packages as background research, and edit other writers for publication.

Writing for Fashion Designers enables Fashion majors to explore the variety of writings in and about their discipline while developing essential communications skills through frequent writing assignments. The course is integral to the senior project for Fashion majors.COURSE DESCRIPTIONAll fashion designers have to tell the story of their creative vision - who they are, what inspires them, what their aspirations are for their designs. Thus, we will write across a variety of genres - from fact-based reporting to field notes to aspirational statements - to get a feel for some of the tools and techniques available to you as designers. This course is designed to give you intensive practice in essential language skills that you will use throughout your life, as a student, as a citizen, and as a designer. These include aural and visual modes of language processing: listening, reading, speaking and writing. While our goal is to craft and polish drafts to narrate your senior project, we will be employing all four of these modes as you draft, revise, and polish your writing projects. We will investigate ideas of &#34;fashion&#34; throughout the term, and look at the methods used to talk about why we make what we make and why we wear what we wear. Reading goes hand-in-hand with writing and each week you will engage in broader cultural conversations via texts - books, Web sites, films, etc. You will develop a point of view on your own work and others&#39; work - by engaging with theory, critical review, magazine and newspaper articles, and field work. This course is designed for Fashion Design majors. All others who wish to enroll must have instructor approval."

Surveying European and American painting in the period from 1945 to 1985, this course will consider the following questions: How do we understand this important oscillation in the history of modern and postmodern art? How did painting respond, not only to the challenges of photography, film, and mass-market print culture, but to the rise of global commodity culture, the trauma of world war and genocide, struggles for civil rights, and the emergence of twentieth-century feminism? How has painting coped with art movements such as Minimalism and Conceptualism, by which it was aggressively marginalized?

Second, it encounters critical readings on the &#34;essence&#34; of technology from philosophical and social-theory perspectives, including Martin Heidegger&#39;s Question of Technology, the computer theories of Alan Turing, and Friedrich Kittler&#39;s extensive studies on digital and information culture especially in their relations to military strategy. Finally, it evaluates texts on non-human, species and animal ethics by such theorists as Peter Singer, followed by readings prioritizing &#34;roboethics&#34; (Gianmarco Veruggio) - the ethics for humans in their dealings with machines - as well as &#34;machine ethics&#34; (Mitchell Waldrop) - the ethics that might be anticipated from machines which have reached sufficient sophistication to be compared to human abilities and emotions. Through these themes it is hoped that CCA students will be better equipped to understand, evaluate, and deal with some major ethical ramifications of our technological age."

Students consider multiple perspectives and claims in the process of formulating independent, well-founded opinions.Mainstream cultures often give rise to their “counter”: Counter-culture. This course considers the flowering of such countercultures in a variety of civilizations from Abraham and Prometheus to the present day, and reflects both on what they share in common and how they remain distinctive, in particular with regard to the proliferation of “Bohemias” within modern material civilization. The first part of the course looks at a group of early exemplifications of counterculture. It considers Socrates and the Socratic counterculture, including its ramifications in the development of Socrates’ student Diogenes and the Cynics. It evaluates the countercultural functions of early Taoism and its relation to nature, alchemy, and the elixir of immortality. It compares mainstream Buddhism to the body of countercultural features within the Buddhist tradition, including Ch’an/Zen and the Siddha tradition of Tantric India. It traces the origins and ramifications of the Sufi element in the Islamic tradition and its capacities to merge with other countercultural patterns in the regions converted to Islam. And it traces the emergence of “romantic” and “magical” Love among the medieval Troubadours and their links to the esoteric movement known as Catharism within and without Christianity. The second part then more directly considers aspects the counterculture in early modern European societies and civilizations. It follows the countercultural bent within the range of groupings and movements that came to be known as the Enlightenment during the eighteenth century and their connections to revolutionary transformation during the French Revolution. It studies the origins of the American counterculture in the New England Transcendentalist thinkers led by Emerson, Fuller, and Thoreau. And it provides an account for the origins and maturation of “Bohemia” as an artistic-social siting in Paris during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The third and final part considers the explicit manifestations of counterculture in modern and postmodern societies, including its theoretical-ideological justifications. Major topics include the rise of the Beat movement in the late 1940s and 1950s, its transmutation into the Youth movement and counterculture of the 1960s, and the more recent fate of the counterculture since the 1970s as in the cases of New Age, Punk and DIY. A closing theme is the connections between counterculture and the growth of global digital society, social media, and its dissident elements in the early twenty-first century."

Through social media technology has become the architect even of our most private lives. Technology begins to create its own momentum and now threatens to surpass our abilities to control it. The implications of our having become addicted to technology as the answer to every problem is the focus of this class, where we question a technology that, while taking over our lives, seems to be taking on a life of its own: Are we to be slaves to or masters of technology? Will our technological future include human values and humane sensibilities, or will humanity itself be so transformed by technologies as to become something entirely different from who we are now, a Humanity 2.0? In particular we will consider the opposition between the techno-optimists, who see technology as our savior, and the techno-pessimists, who view our growing dependence on technology with alarm. Perhaps the most important question for us concerns the role of the artist in a world dominated by technological thinking? The course will include many documentaries and other graphic illustrations of concepts."

Where do they get their ideas about surviving and thriving in the larger world, and what radical shifts in thinking might be necessary and/or in the making? This course looks at innovative projects by creative thinkers – artists, scientists and activists – who propose novel approaches to environmental issues in practical and often paradigm-shifting terms. Students are asked to develop their own creative project addressing concerns of sustainability and the environment. The class also investigates the still-developing set of attitudes about nature stemming from early American writers on nature such as Emerson, Thoreau and Muir -- along with later ones such as Rachel Carson and Anna Tsing -- while also engaging with later “eco-poetical” thinking from contemporary critical voices concerned with how people “treat” all kinds of nature, including their by-products and waste that have become second nature -- from housing developments and radioactive nuclear fallout to human shit. These writings question humans’ relationships to other species, the environment and multiple different “natures” -- in the real world and in the imagination. Among others’ creative projects to be explored will be work by Futurefarmers, Patricia Johanson, and Bonnie Ora Sherk, as well as a conceptual park commemorating smog, a speculative museum tracking the sources and consequences of waste, and an unusual zero-carbon building material made from living forms that are neither plant nor animal, along with considerations of everything from urban beekeeping and rooftop gardens to grappling with species extinction, climate change and the Great Pacific Plastic Gyre."

Contrary to this linear sense of historical development however, Afro-futurism has emerged, over the past thirty years, as an alternative critical practice that time travels, journeying from the past to present in order to use the history of black diasporic culture in the aim of thinking the present as well as imagining new futures that have yet to arrive. Taking our cue from Samuel Delaney, for whom science fiction, if anything, functions as a “means through which to re-program the present,” in this course we will go in search of the radical visions and anticipatory political imaginaries of a range of afrofuturists (Samuel Delany, John Akomfrah, Octavia Butler, Harriet Jacobs, among others) who, through their aesthetic practice, open up new ways of seeing and imagining new futures for black liberation."

Students contextualize these dynamics within the emerging trend of physical and psychological divides occurring across the globe, including Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the European Union. The course critically analyzes governments overreliance on fortification walls to address economic and humanitarian crises. This approach often leads to disastrous social and ecological impacts as evidenced by the division of longstanding communities and the interruption of native flora/fauna.

Weekly demonstrations and individual projects guide students through weekly experimentation and towards a comprehensive body of artwork in the book form. The class includes an introduction to letterpress printing with handset type and polymer plates, artist multiples and editioning, text and image sequencing, with field trips and special collection visits to view historical and contemporary book art works. Open to beginning and advanced students from any program. "

Through field trips, guest artists/curators, one-on-one meetings, readings, visits to studios and exhibitions, students will consider the artist&#39;s working process and the presentation of work. Class dialogue, rigorous evaluation of each student&#39;s work, and refining creative practice will be important components of the class. Junior and senior projects courses are often paired and cross-disciplinary to build community, mentorship opportunities and professional relationships."

The class examines the creative interventions of artists at these thresholds and boundaries between natural sites, processes, and objects. Extensive discussions and presentations help develop a deeper understanding of this complicated history over time along with the role of emerging technologies, both in contemporary art practice and earlier creative human activity with the natural world. Assigned readings are a regular part of the class along with a series of projects to mine and visualize your own private relationship and history between the natural and artificial, the raw and the cooked.

The course will analyze the increasingly important role of campaign financing, social media, and other modes of representation in elections in contemporary American politics and how civil society as well as political units such as interest groups, political parties, political action committees (PACs), super PACs, and the media influence the policy making process. The course will introduce how Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court operate, both in theory and in practice, and how they work for, and sometimes fail, the interests of the nation. Through various pedagogical tools, students learn to think analytically and systematically about American politics, and the importance of the study of American government. This course has two secondary objectives. First, the course reviews the contours of democracy in contemporary political and civic life and asks these questions: What facilitates democratic life? What is civil discourse and its engagement? How do we attend to questions of identity and difference (e.g., gender, class, race, gender identity and expression, religious affiliation, etc.) in democratic practices? How do we address systemic and structural inequalities such as racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, for example? Is voting all that matters? Does democracy mean majority wins all, all the time? What is the role of dissent in a democratic society? Second, as the semester progresses, you will be required to not only interrogate political discourses, but also be asked to reflect upon your own positions and how to situate it in the broader context of local, national, and international discourses. In other words, this course compels students to ask where are we headed as a nation, what criteria do we use to evaluate a desirable outcome and for whom, and if it is not on a suitable course for yourself and others, then what can we do to change it, if at all?"

As a result, the urban landscape is endlessly re-imagined, redesigned, and rearranged in an ongoing process of urban development. This class will explore the changing physical landscape of the city as an expression of its socio-economic and political context. We will analyze the city by examining how social attitudes, economic conditions, and cultural perspectives have interacted, often in contradictory ways, to shape the processes of growth and development.  Through readings, discussions, lectures, videos, group exercises, project research, and field experiences students will build an understanding of urban cultural landscapes. The class will trace the history of cultural change and social conflict in the Bay Area specifically, as a way to illustrate how cities in general develop as collections of spatial enclaves that are experienced, understood and acted upon differently by various inhabitants and social groups.Social Science and History (SSHIS) courses develop students&#39; critical thinking skills through the study of history and the social sciences (e.g. sociology, psychology, economics, political science, anthropology, geography), as well as through contemporary interdisciplines that draw heavily on these fields (e.g. feminist and queer studies, media studies, urban studies, ethnic studies).

Is there a universal distinction between dreams, visions and or other hallucinatory types of experience? Has dreaming been historically and cross-culturally viewed as another form of thinking related to the irrational? What is the connection between dreams, visions, trance, and religion?

Are heroes still necessary or even possible in contemporary cultures? Why are villains so prevalent? Real life heroes and villains have played a crucial role in the history of nations and civilizations from ancient to contemporary times. Often honored by society but sometimes feared or disdained, heroes (male and female) reflect and shape standards of excellence, provide inspiration, overcome adversity, pursue ideals, lead, and challenge. Villains can question convention and test ideals, and lead and challenge as well. Both heroes and villains can problematize cultural values by pushing boundaries, transgressing, and transcending them. What do the real life heroes and villains of a particular age and place say about that time period and culture? How is a hero different from a leader or role model? Does every age get the heroes it deserves? What qualities or deeds qualify a person for hero status? Have the characteristics of heroes changed over time? Why are villains so transfixing? Is it possible to be simultaneously a hero and a villain? In this course we will study recognized political, intellectual, creative, and social heroes from diverse cultures and historical time periods, select villains, and theories of heroism."

The course operates as a research laboratory where students familiarize themselves with the social, political and economic dynamics at the U.S.- Mexican border through the works of writers, artists, architects and activists (e.g. Gloria Anzaldua, Teddy Cruz, Marcos Ramirez ERRE, Fiamma Montezemolo and Ana Teresa Fernandez). Students contextualize these dynamics within the emerging trend of physical and psychological divides occurring across the globe, including Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the European Union. The course critically analyzes governments overreliance on fortification walls to address economic and humanitarian crises. This approach often leads to disastrous social and ecological impacts as evidenced by the division of longstanding communities and the interruption of native flora/fauna. We also look at the value placed on natural resources within borderlands, whether it be through acts of conservation or extraction. A special focus is dedicated to understanding how local populations uphold ancestral connections with their land through the practice of indigenous stewardship, self-determination and radical organization to combat corporate interests.Social Science and History (SSHIS) courses develop students&#39; critical thinking skills through the study of history and the social sciences (e.g. sociology, psychology, economics, political science, anthropology, geography), as well as through contemporary interdisciplines that draw heavily on these fields (e.g. feminist and queer studies, media studies, urban studies, ethnic studies).

All are paths taken to demonstrate opposition to existing conditions, but revolution is the collective action that aims at the most drastic change. Originally an astronomical term, what does revolution currently mean? What are the motivations for revolutionary political change? What role do ideas and ideology play? What transforms individual anger into revolutionary process? How is it sustained against counter-mobilizing forces? Why do people risk their lives to participate in revolution? What is the measure of a successful revolution? Why do some succeed and others fail? Are revolutions necessarily violent or can there be nonviolent revolutions? In this course, we will begin by examining the classic examples of the American, French, Russian, and Chinese Revolutions (the models that have inspired other revolutions), as well as the Haitian Revolution (the most successful slave revolution). We then move on to consider some major contemporary revolutions in non-western societies. Are their essential features similar or unique? We will analyze theories about causes, events, outcomes and processes. Are there factors and theories that consistently and adequately explain revolutions?"

In addition to recreating social life and economic systems, consumerism has dictated metropolitan development patterns and has reshaped global geography through its impacts on international trade and the natural environment. At the same time that the consumption economy has been instrumental to creating new landscapes – both spatial and cultural, it has also reinforced old patterns of social inequity and injustice. This class will investigate the development of our consumer society and explore the ethics of consumption by looking at how various consumer spaces and sectors reflect attitudes about gender, class and race while also paying attention to the environmental impacts of mass consumption. The class will be structured in three units: Unit 1 will trace the rise of consumer society in the United States. Unit 2 will examine the impacts of the globalization of consumer goods. Unit 3 will give students an opportunity to explore their own interests through a research project that will be shared with the class."

By the end of this course, students will develop deeper historical, philosophical and political literacies of diversity and inclusion through the lens of intersectionality.  While this course is structured by historical, theoretical, and philosophical texts produced by peoples in struggle globally, it centers how Black women have engaged such thinking, transnationally.  By the end of this course, students will develop representational pieces that situate their own evolving relationship to intersectionality historically. "

The course will analyze the increasingly important role of campaign financing, social media, and other modes of representation in elections in contemporary American politics and how civil society as well as political units such as interest groups, political parties, political action committees (PACs), super PACs, and the media influence the policy making process. The course will introduce how Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court operate, both in theory and in practice, and how they work for, and sometimes fail, the interests of the nation. Through various pedagogical tools, students learn to think analytically and systematically about American politics, and the importance of the study of American government. This course has two secondary objectives. First, the course reviews the contours of democracy in contemporary political and civic life and asks these questions: What facilitates democratic life? What is civil discourse and its engagement? How do we attend to questions of identity and difference (e.g., gender, class, race, gender identity and expression, religious affiliation, etc.) in democratic practices? How do we address systemic and structural inequalities such as racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, for example? Is voting all that matters? Does democracy mean majority wins all, all the time? What is the role of dissent in a democratic society? Second, as the semester progresses, you will be required to not only interrogate political discourses, but also be asked to reflect upon your own positions and how to situate it in the broader context of local, national, and international discourses. In other words, this course compels students to ask where are we headed as a nation, what criteria do we use to evaluate a desirable outcome and for whom, and if it is not on a suitable course for yourself and others, then what can we do to change it, if at all"

Using an intersectional approach, we will explore a breadth of work produced by and about Black women who too often lose their rightful place as leaders of revolution and struggle. Upon studying the practice and revolutionary politics of women who not only criticized capitalism but also challenged it, what frameworks of analysis do we gain from them that we can use to make sense of our contemporary moment? What limitations do we still face? Our course will examine historical figures like Harriet Tubman, Ella Baker and Mamie Till who radicalized freedom struggles as much as we will explore the ways critical Black feminist frameworks have been depoliticized within the liberal university settings that produce our newest revolutionaries. We will explore these tensions and contradictions as we work to theorize the dialectical entanglements of race, gender, and capitalism. We will ask ourselves what critical Black feminist thinking means for our collective liberation, and how we can articulate these visions of freedom in what we produce."

Artists working in interdisciplinary zones are picking up needle and thread to utilize a constellation of ideas embedded in textile making and thinking—which might be best described as “textilities.” The interplay of threads at multiple intersection points builds a cohesive whole from disparate, yet equal elements. This arrangement offers a blueprint for thinking about interconnectivity, relational experience, and nonhierarchical structures in creative, linguistic, and activist arenas. Textiles propose radical ways of thinking in a moment of return to wisdom practices.This hybrid theory/making class, now taught fully online, is designed and team taught by Hennessy and Valoma. It is intended for students working in any discipline who are interested in investigating the sensorial, ephemeral, and performative underpinnings of the medium through making, extensive reading, discussion, lectures, written assignments, and critiques. It may be taken to fulfill Topic Seminar, Studio 2/3, or Studio Elective requirements.Online course sections will be delivered mostly asynchronously, with some synchronous components that will be outlined in the course syllabus if applicable."

As a creative process, this class will focus on public engagement as a cross-disciplinary studio practice, to explore spaces of temporality and movement in our everyday world such as commuter communities (or purposeful temporal communities), terrestrial pathways, urban responses to conditions of need or change, virtual spaces such as social media platforms, natural environments and systems of circulation in our local/global world that are both living and inanimate. What kinds of relationships form in these spaces and how can creative ideas be used to activate and explore them?Through a series of self-guided field experiences and assignments, you will learn about observation and mapping tools that will help you to better examine traces from crossed paths and movement flows, and support your investigation into the multiplicity of possible creative interactions and exchanges with others in these momentary places. We will hear from and meet a diverse group of guest designers/artists and interdisciplinary researchers who have studied, navigated and animated public spaces within and across disciplinary boundaries, such as social geographers, urban planners and artists, designers who examine social and place based patterns in our world.As a student you will call on your lived experiences as a tool for curiosity. Class assignments will help you to develop new thinking, inquiries, and strategies for your current practice, through the lens of design, performance, visual arts, surveying, recorded experiences, exchanges, installations or public dialogues as midterm and final projects. In this course you will engage in both individual and collective opportunities through assignments that can play out in either site-specific or virtual spaces.

Scientists engage with the real world and filter vast amounts of potential information down to a comprehensible data set through the use of instruments. Many artists do the same thing by creating conceptual or physical instruments or &#39;devices of constraint&#39; to reduce subjectivity in the art-making process. We will take a close look at scientific practice in a range of fields, be exposed to artists who are delving into this territory and then be inspired to develop our own prototype instruments. The final project for the studio will be artist-developed instruments that encourage and enable a new perspective on the physical world around us. We will collaborate with the Exploratorium in San Francisco during this studio. This course will meet both in-person and online. Students must be able to attend the in-person component in order to enroll in the course.

Sound is an object:  a physical waveform that we can map, control, and manipulate. It is also playful, and it is this element that guides our exploration into how we play in sounds and spaces, and how they play back. In this course we will look at the relationship between sound, space, installation, and performance, shifting the emphasis from the visual to the aural and corporeal – from what we see to what we hear and feel. We will question how architectures and designs around us manipulate and guide sounds, and we will use sound to create our own places of sonic sculpture. Whether through voice, instruments, acoustical reverberations, or software-driven manipulations, students will begin to explore sound as both a physical waveform and an ephemeral entity, creating instruments, installations, and performances that engage sound and space as active mediums."

The course is also part of a collaborative: E SCHOOL : A fine arts, H&amp;S, and Architecture environmental justice collaborative.  How do we make sense of historical decisions as we reflect now on the consequences of climate change on our parks and leisure? What role can art and design play in a redefinition of human interaction in wilderness and urban parks?  How can we protect the fragility rivers and creeks in the face of environmental challenges to water? What do relational human pathways look like? What decisions can we make? Each of these areas mitigate complex histories as natural celebrations, catharsis, memorials, monuments.  Depending on student locations, social distancing, and access to transportation, we will visit parks such as a TBA national park, Angel Island, China Camp, Rush Ranch Preserve, and the Albany Bulb. If you are international, and can visit parks where you are, that too can be your subject to make work about. The Park is an adaptation of desire for both history and nature in close proximities. Parks are also sites for social contradictions. Interdisciplinary projects will respond to these parks with an eye towards environmental justice impacts.Leisure time looks different due to Covid 19. Have you been able to integrate leisure time into your current circumstances? If not, we will construct a pathway forward, and if so, we will begin to study the nuances of nature and the edges of our urban localities.

This advanced level studio is thematic in nature. Technical demonstrations are paired with thoughtful readings, seminar discussions and ambitious projects. Collaboration, experimentation and presentation skills are developed in concert with critical thinking.Section DescriptionInsights in Site examines how we shift from individual care to collective, shared care through embodied, personal engagements and layered interactions with our local communities and broader society. By charting our personal experiences to multi-disciplinary activations, students will engage in “care in place” using creative practices as a conduit to explore multi-sensory and somatic investigations in and around indoor and outdoor space. We upend traditional understanding of care towards more integrated and embodied experiences, examining how caring is translated to belonging and healing. We explore how identity, lived experience and ecology influence our creative-making process to (re)define common ground. Students will start by building awareness in relation to self, senses, environment, people and society. Juxtaposing personal practices of care with sensory investigations and spatial activations, students will test new sensory skills and share and build from differences of personal experiences.  Through reflection, experimentation and interdisciplinary collaboration, the outcomes of this course will be a series of responses that reflect the comforts and discomforts of care, healing and belonging."

We observe and experience various forms of conflict in our personal, social and political lives today. To achieve a harmonious life, it is important to know how we handle such conflicts constructively and turn our experience into a creative work which we share with our communities. The course focuses on three methodologies of transforming conflict, Music and Body, Conversation, and Parallel Narratives. Participants are expected to complete three projects respectively applying those methodologies to their current specializations. Around each project, participants will work on various in-class exercises often collaboratively to put this challenging topic and methodologies into practice. Students form all majors are welcomed. Let&#39;s deal with conflict we face creatively and transform it into a work that has an actual impact and poetics for a wider variety of interpretation."

Centuries of mediation can be traced along the intersections of ADT from the paintbrush to 3 point perspective, the photograph to augmented reality--- how the real is represented/seen/unseen/authenticated/believed/valued or included, is not a natural or random fact, but rather an entry point to interpreting visual codes and meanings that shape social conditions and workings of power in everyday life: constructs of race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability. ADT as media fields not only reflect opinions and conventions of taste, but rather, encounters with media in these fields are considered among the forms through which human subjects are ‘made’, as citizens, consumers, and as enculturated social beings. The ‘fictive art’ premise grounds the theoretical inquiry and interdisciplinary studio practices, emerging media, installation and performance."

Merging the philosophical, the critical, and the creative, worldbuilding is a holistic and expansive interdisciplinary art form emerging from the great narrative, aesthetic, and design traditions. Worldbuilders invent imaginary worlds that act, at once, as playgrounds for their imaginations, as tools of critique to turn on our own imperfect, real-world, and as lenses to spy a possible vision of a better civilization.  In this course, through collaboration and leveraging a multiplicity of disciplines and practices, students will build worlds while expanding and broadening their own artistic practice through exploring different interdisciplinary approaches to worldbuilding. Students will analyze and critique both well known and obscure imaginary worlds in literature, fine arts, cinema, and games. Students will learn the worldbuilding process and methodologies, and engage in both collaborative and individual worldbuilding through studio assignments in worlds they themselves create, including textual, 2D, 3D, and 4D worldbuilding projects. "

Collaboration, experimentation and presentation skills are developed in concert with critical thinking.Section DescriptionThis topic based course “Queer Super Objects” explores the evolving history of LGBTQ&#43; iconography translated into physical forms. The Rainbow Flag designed by Gilbert Baker in 1978, commissioned by Harvey Milk, is a prime example of a group idea that crossed mediums in forms of graphics, jewelry, fashion, ceramics and public art. Inventing a visual language to symbolize counter-cultural identity was an artist driven responsibility since the Stonewall Riots in 1969. The Names Project Aids Quilt still involves thousands of participants sewing memorial quilts to exhibit in public spaces like the Mall in Washington DC. Inter-disciplinary projects will address Queer Representation with assignments to design and fabricate an inclusive platform for non- conformists. Technical demos and in-person workshops will focus on mixed media approaches for making prototypes, molds and casting editions using both traditional materials and recycled objects. Asynchronous research will include readings, documentary films and Pop Culture updates. Weekly slide lectures on Out Queer Artists since the 1890’s, (Oscar Wilde as a starting point ) will explore the decade by decade cultural breakthroughs in Art and Politics to inform a sense of Queer History. A final ‘in-person’ collaborative project will engage students to integrate their personal creativity into a tangible monument marking 50 years of Queerness with a new generation’s concerns. This course will meet both in-person and online. Students must be able to attend the in-person component in order to enroll in the course. The in-person components of this section will meet in San Francisco and will have hands-on technical workshops that include casting plaster and mold-making. Students who are unable to meet the in-person requirements of the course should be enrolled in an online-only course. Hybrid course sections will be delivered both online and in-person. Required online synchronous meeting times are listed as the meeting pattern for this course section. Additional course components will be delivered asynchronously or in-person as outlined in the syllabus. A student enrolled in a hybrid course can only meet the in-person requirements with physical presence.The in-person component is integral to successful completion of the course. All students enrolled in the hybrid course are subject to the same in-person requirements.

This course invites students to envision the possibility of fluid and dynamic relationships that embrace change and adaptability. In doing so, we will examine our responsibility to water as a “common” resource, including the ways we use water, the dynamics of flow, and the social-natural ecologies of the watershed.Students will imagine, explore, and prototype water-related scenarios, while addressing the multiple scales of reciprocal relationships between people and water – from molecular and micro-organic, through skin and body, to regional and potentially global. The outcome of the course will be a series of projects, implemented in tangible prototypes that represent various imagined possibilities of how we interact with water."

But after more than 50 years, many people still can&#39;t say when the season begins or ends. They are mystified about how television is made, ignorant of basic tenets like demographics or ratings, programming trends, ownership or the demands of advertising. In this class, we&#39;ll learn how television is made (sausage or magic?) from pitch to production. Understanding the basics will allow you, through critical analysis, to better understand and evaluate what you&#39;re watching, and hopefully allow that critical development to come into play as you view your own work and the work of others."

Artifacts need representation. Online magazines, books, mobile devices, trackers, bikes, buildings and shoes work across popular culture to construct desire through representation. This theory-based seminar examines numerous, desirable artifacts from late twentieth century to the present. We will evaluate the complex influence we (as makers) exert on popular culture and its equally forceful influence on us. Guided by informative texts through an examination of star-quality artifacts, we will critique production, consumption, and representation and question the distinction between want and need. Readings provide a critical understanding of design, consumption, and the changing urban behaviors that result in endless surfaces made available for the image through consumer-oriented phenomena such as &#34;station domination&#34; in the physical world and those used in social media. The readings for this seminar address artifacts from a variety of design disciplines and investigate connections among artifact, image, and popular consumer culture."

We will consider the role of media and visual culture in formations of gender, sexuality, and relations of power, and examine feminist approaches to art and activism that have emerged to address contemporary gendered inequalities. Readings and works to be discussed will emphasize transnational conversations and phenomena, not merely to critique and de-center the centrality of Euro-U.S. feminist dialogues, but to underscore the historical links between different forms of feminist movements across the globe. Coursework and class discussions will focus on developing our understanding of the dynamic relation of feminist art, activism, and knowledge production to debates around such topics as migration, militarization, labor, imperialism, mass imprisonment, and human rights. Artists to be discussed include Emily Jacir, Mona Hatoum, Tania Bruguera, Regina Jose Galindo, Zanele Muholi, Wu Mali, and Hung Liu, among others."

This course will offer an historical overview of the role that the Silk Road played in the transmission of religions, cultures and the arts from their local origins to all other regions of the entire continent of Asia (in its expanded sense and not the modern colonial definition of just East and South Asia). The main focus, however, will be on various traditional and contemporary artistic practices of each region through a close examination of exemplary cases from the eastern, southern, central, and western parts of the continent, as well as a serious consideration of their interconnected-ness. "

The built environment and bodies maintain an extensive and complex relationship. The analogies between the two are as old as history, specifically from a Western cultural perspective. From the caryatid to the cathedral, the bathroom to the bachelor pad, city planning/architecture to space/furniture, arguably have taken their cues from identifying markers of the human body. Conversely, individuals define their identities in relation to the spaces and places they inhabit, as in the case of the office worker, the student , the housewife/husband, the club-hopper, the streetwalker, the homeless, and the physically challenged. The built environment shapes us even as we create it, in a constant conversation and exchange between interiority and exteriority - between perceptions of who we are and where we are situated. Science, psychology, and philosophy have all had their turns in scrutinising the body and it&#39;s functions. And yet, in the design professions, few have attempted to take the study of the body beyond the simple project of outlining its objectifiable performance criteria (anthropometrics). The presumed utility of ergonomics, as the ultimate &#34;science&#34; of observing and representing user needs, is predicated, to some extent, on both the convenience of a generic user body and the denial of the ethnographer&#39;s (ergonomicist&#39;s) own subjectivity. In this seminar, we will survey contemporary and historical writings about the body and its relationship to physical and social worlds, we will attempt to forge an experimental approach to (designing with/for) the body."

Students will also engage with the relevant primary/secondary literature for the topic at hand. Courses will pay particular attention to the larger cultural, historical, and theoretical/ideological contexts in which the visual artifacts and structures under consideration were created.COURSE DESCRIPTIONThe last two decades have witnessed increased institutional recognition for major African-American artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, as well as the emergence of a distinct term, “black contemporary art,” coined in 2011 by blogger and museum worker Kimberly Drew (aka &#64;museummammy). Art movement and hashtag in equal measure, black contemporary art collects under its capacious banner a new range of artists of the African diaspora, and over the last several years has increasingly shaped how black artists and their works are presented and understood. The basic premise of the course is to look at, read and think about a small range of artists and exhibitions associated with the term. In doing so, it imposes certain boundaries. It largely examines artists who were born after the Civil Rights Movement, and largely artists whose work emerged in the 21st century. These are, therefore, artists formed as much by the Cosby Show, the identity politics of the 1990s, and social media, as by the momentous movements of the 1960s. This means as well that these artists have a diverse (and sometimes skeptical) relationship to blackness as it was defined in the Sixties; this is part of what makes their work “contemporary.” This history therefore begins with the 2001 Studio Museum exhibition Freestyle, in which context curator Thelma Golden introduced her controversial notion of “post-black” art. A second critical moment is found in Renaissance Society exhibition Black Is, Black Ain’t, curated by Hamza Walker in 2008. Using these exhibitions as framing devices, the course proceeds through monographic seminars focused on individual artists, including Kara Walker, Wangechi Mutu, Kehinde Wiley, and a trio of younger artists (Juliana Huxtable, Martine Syms and Hannah Black) in the first half of the semester (Side 1). Rodney McMillian, Theaster Gates, LaToya Ruby Frazier and Kerry James Marshall follow in the second (Side 2). We will discern their particular approaches to medium, aesthetics and art history, and furthermore locate their work in terms of relevant social and cultural contexts: globalism, the art market, pop culture, and the contemporary politics of race."

Lines of inquiry probe the myriad tensions associated with the expansion and complication of African photographic practices during the 20th century to our present moment. A wide range of examples will be examined including but not limited to: nineteenth-century African studio photography in Sierra Leone, royal photography, new global visibility of mid-twentieth century work by West African photographers, Seydou Keita, Malick Sidibé, and Samuel Fosso, photographs in important visual cultural outlets like the South African Drum Magazine, and works by contemporary African photographers. The political and stylistic aspects of portraiture, documentary, ethnography, pop and abstraction will be important to the discussion of the medium. Students will develop an understanding of the nuances of the frameworks and histories of photography in Africa and the African diaspora, while gaining an awareness of the vitality of photography as a dominant language of contemporary African art today. Requirements will include a balance of reading and discussion, research, writing, presentation, and original artistic responses to the material as well as trips to area exhibitions."

Aspiring to develop a global perspective, it brings 20 th and 21 st century Western aesthetic theories by Theodor Adorno, Susan Sontag, Arthur Danto, or Alain Badiou into conversation with thinkers such as Yuriko Saito, Liu Yuedi, Gayatri Spivak, Eva Kit Wah Man, or Felwine Sarr. Drawing on these diverse theoretical positions, we will explore a wide range of topics in order to investigate what the nature of art is and what significance it has in relation to our existence under late-modern conditions. Our discussions will revolve around questions such as “Is there any specific quality that all works of art have in common?”, “Is art universal—or does the meaning of ‘art’ change across different cultural contexts?”, “How is art related to other domains—most importantly, to technology and to politics?”, “What (and who?!?) determines whether an artwork has value?”, “What standards are there for art criticism?”, “Why do we care whether or not an artwork is authentic?”, and “Can art transform us in productive, enriching ways?&#34;"

To this end, we will investigate the meaning of postmodernism as a theory, an aesthetic notion, a politics, and a periodization. The objective of the course is to gain a sense of the major ideas, movements, and figures in contemporary art, as well as a better understanding of the social, cultural, and intellectual contexts in which these objects and ideas have emerged.

Through the study of key artists, movements, and works of art, we will explore the entanglements between politics and aesthetics in Latin America, with a particular focus on art as a practice of intervention and social critique. Towards this end, we will examine the relationship of art and visual culture to a range of social phenomena, including nationalism; modernization; countercultural and revolutionary movements; political repression under military dictatorships; cross-border migration; and globalization. We will consider how artists&#39; engagements with these themes have contributed to conversations around a number of conceptual and theoretical concerns, and trace these contributions through close readings of images, manifestos, critical essays and curatorial statements. Students will gain an understanding of stylistic developments in Latin American art throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, develop formal analysis skills, and hone their ability to interpret visual texts through short writing assignments."

The course offers at the same time a closer look at specific media and presentation contexts in which artists have been active. From television to fairs and festivals, from physical archives to online platforms - artists and institutions have explored alternative ways to exhibit and distribute works of media art that go beyond the museum and gallery context. The goal of the course is to enable students to critically engage with a dynamic field of technology, art praxis and theory. Students will come to understand ideas and concepts related to old and new technologies and will apply these concepts to the critical analysis of specific works and contexts of presentation, distribution, and publishing."

Representations of crime correspond to histories of racialization and ideologies about gender and sexuality, shaping how we understand policing, surveillance, criminality, jails, and prisons.

Americans, through their economic clout as much as their tastes, have heavily influenced the development of global fashion. Our media-driven worship of the celebrity designer, the unattainable aesthetic ideals projected by top models, and our new-found interest in sustainability are merely the latest twists in an old story. This class will examine the historical and theoretical underpinnings of the fashion system in America, beginning with the importation of the couture system from mid-nineteenth-century Paris and continuing to the present. This is an upper-level undergraduate seminar. Extensive outside reading, several organized class presentations, and active participation in class discussions are required.

The course begins with a brief survey of the French academies and the official exhibitions they organized called salons. International Expositions and World Fairs also played an important role in bringing art movements to the public’s attention. However, the bulk of the course will focus on modern and contemporary art exhibitions, which can be said to begin with the 1863 Salon des Refusés in Paris. This exhibition challenged the conservative notion of art sanctioned by official national bodies and initiated our more contemporary understanding of art as a radical intervention into cultural life. Among the other case studies are key touchstone exhibitions in the history of modern and contemporary art.In addition, the course will focus on the importance of Biennials and Universal Expositions as a way to adapt exhibitions to a more global network of nations, institutions, and the growing influence of commercial galleries. World Fairs place art in the context of innovations in Industry and Technology, beginning with The Great Exhibition, London, 1851. Taking place largely in Europe and America, these fairs introduced national pavilions on the model of expositions that broadened global cultural exchanges, although often simultaneously reinforcing stereotypes about non-western populations. Biennials offer a more culturally sensitive exchange. The course will consider innovative curatorial strategies introduced at key Biennials, such as Venice, São Paulo, Habana, Istanbul, Dak’Art, and Gwangju. It concludes with a consideration of recent exhibitions designed to engage with activist issues and artists whose work is characterized by relational aesthetics and social practice."

This course will offer an historical overview of the role that the Silk Road played in the transmission of religions, cultures and the arts from their local origins to all other regions of the entire continent of Asia (in its expanded sense and not the modern colonial definition of just East and South Asia). The main focus, however, will be on various traditional and contemporary artistic practices of each region through a close examination of exemplary cases from the eastern, southern, central, and western parts of the continent, as well as a serious consideration of their interconnected-ness. "

Artifacts need representation. Online magazines, books, mobile devices, trackers, bikes, buildings and shoes work across popular culture to construct desire through representation. This theory-based seminar examines numerous, desirable artifacts from late twentieth century to the present. We will evaluate the complex influence we (as makers) exert on popular culture and its equally forceful influence on us. Guided by informative texts through an examination of star-quality artifacts, we will critique production, consumption, and representation and question the distinction between want and need. Readings provide a critical understanding of design, consumption, and the changing urban behaviors that result in endless surfaces made available for the image through consumer-oriented phenomena such as &#34;station domination&#34; in the physical world and those used in social media. The readings for this seminar address artifacts from a variety of design disciplines and investigate connections among artifact, image, and popular consumer culture."

The built environment and bodies maintain an extensive and complex relationship. The analogies between the two are as old as history, specifically from a Western cultural perspective. From the caryatid to the cathedral, the bathroom to the bachelor pad, city planning/architecture to space/furniture, arguably have taken their cues from identifying markers of the human body. Conversely, individuals define their identities in relation to the spaces and places they inhabit, as in the case of the office worker, the student , the housewife/husband, the club-hopper, the streetwalker, the homeless, and the physically challenged. The built environment shapes us even as we create it, in a constant conversation and exchange between interiority and exteriority - between perceptions of who we are and where we are situated. Science, psychology, and philosophy have all had their turns in scrutinising the body and it&#39;s functions. And yet, in the design professions, few have attempted to take the study of the body beyond the simple project of outlining its objectifiable performance criteria (anthropometrics). The presumed utility of ergonomics, as the ultimate &#34;science&#34; of observing and representing user needs, is predicated, to some extent, on both the convenience of a generic user body and the denial of the ethnographer&#39;s (ergonomicist&#39;s) own subjectivity. In this seminar, we will survey contemporary and historical writings about the body and its relationship to physical and social worlds, we will attempt to forge an experimental approach to (designing with/for) the body."

The course will revolve around a specific theme selected by the instructor.COURSE DESCRIPTIONWith the ultimate goal of building upon the writing, reading and analytical skills developed in Writing 1, and crafting mid size critical college essays, this course will examine travel narratives in essays and literature to probe how individuals of various cultures encounter the other, or spaces foreign to them. Textual analysis will be key. The motivation for travel can extend from the spiritual, such as with someone flying off to a yoga retreat in India or a religious missionary, or it can relate to political issues such as conquest or revolutionary resistance, issues of work, or of recreation, or of even familial and cultural reacquaintance. Frequently, these narratives involve a “culture shock” and climax with a change in the traveler, sometimes they even involve a realization of one’s own identity. It is common to think of travel narratives involving cross cultural exchange as having been fashioned into genre(s) by a European man encountering a non European culture with pen and notebook in hand; however, most narratives this class will explore, such as those from Rolando Hinojosa, Rahul Sankrityayan, Ezekial Mphalele and Winnie Wong, will not involve that scenario. Because of this mostly non European focus to narratives involving travel, it is my hope that a more globally-focused discourse concerning travel or cross cultural exchange will afford for a more multifaceted exploration of travel itself then simply one oriented around issues of imperial or colonial power, and exploitation. The history of non European people is much richer and more extensive then aspects relating to having been exploited by imperialist countries."

As part of a pair or trio, each student will help facilitate discussion about a poem, story, or excerpt from a biography or memoir, as well as present contextual information (geographical, historical, cultural, for example) to help us better understand the literary work. Readings are chosen to stimulate discussion and to present both models and inspiration for us to develop our own writing. Although reading and writing are the main emphases, attention will also be given to the research skills necessary for successful academic writing."

The course will revolve around a specific theme selected by the instructor.COURSE DESCRIPTIONThe theme of our summer online Writing 2 course is &#34;Seeing the Virtual.&#34; We often say we live our lives in two spaces-the &#34;real&#34; world of our material experience and the &#34;virtual&#34; world of the internet. But what if we were to imagine the virtual not in opposition to &#34;reality&#34; but as somehow attached to it-stemming from, dependent upon, and capable of changing the &#34;real world.&#34; Perhaps we can think of the virtual the way Marcel Proust described memory: &#34;real but not actual, ideal but not abstract.&#34; In this course we will explore the different ways in which the virtual and the real interact, oppose, and constitute one another through a variety of disciplines and media. From fiction and architecture, to philosophy and video games, we will examine the ways in which (for better or for worse) our virtual selves increasingly determine who we are.This course is offered entirely online. Students must be approved by the instructor in order to register for the course. Please email Brooke Hessler, bhessler&#64;cca.edu, to start the approval process for registration.

Seeing Across is about moving across boundaries real and imagined and both simultaneously. We will place ourselves on the map and we will map the places within ourselves, learning to read the geographies of self and selves. We will also locate ourselves within language, asking: How do we tell stories if we haven’t heard any like our own? How do we tell stories without using the languages we have received from others, languages that might never have imagined us? How do we listen to stories in languages not our own? How do we learn to hear the difference inside the language we think we know? How do we tell stories about (home) places marked by displacement, occupation, and colonization?"

Questions of gender, race, class, and sexuality are “abjected” through monsters, Gothic locations, and mysteries lurking in the shadows. But how do writers and artists harness “the strongest emotion of which the mind is capable”? In this course we will read and view examples from folklore to experimental horror to explore how to build tension in a narrative, when (and when not) to break it, and what to do with the bloody mess that’s leftover. Assignments will range from analytical and creative writing to other visual and auditory narrative mediums."

Providing context for and a deeper understanding of our readings, select topics from environmental science will figure into our course: biodiversity, climate change, population migration, and environmental justice. In particular, we will consider coral reef health; the social and physical legacy of weapons testing; the effect of rising sea levels on peoples and cultures. We&#39;ll encounter celebrated shapeshifters from the mythologies of the Marshall Islands and Hawaii, like Kamapua&#39;a, who appears as a hog or as a human, and Pele, whose volcanic power brings destruction as well as new life. We&#39;ll learn why these eternal trickster figures remain essential to the literature and lives of Pacific peoples. In Robert Barclay&#39;s novel Melal, for example, the fate of a Marshallese family and three American boys on a fishing trip hinges on a game of hide-and-seek played by trickster Etao and dwarf Noniep. Among other writers, hear from Craig Santos Perez of Guam and from Kristiana Kahakauwila of Hawai&#39;i.

It is a basic organizing principle of culture and functions most overtly in its smallest unit, the family. Why? would be a suitable question for a sociology course; as artists, we will ask How? are social class and class issues portrayed in literature and film. How are the rich and the poor perceived by themselves and one another? How has narrative art dealt with the relationship between class, race, and gender? Is class the great equalizer? In what ways has literature depicted success and failure at upward mobility? What is the role of the “middle” class in narrative art?

Ways of Reading focuses on a particular canonical author or text(s), utlizing various critical perspectives and secondary sources to support a deeper understanding of the work. The course further develops and reinforces practical skills in close reading, historical contextualization, applied critical theory, and the use of discipline-specific research tools and resources, encouraging conscious reflection on critical presuppositions and practices. This course prepares students to enter the Critical Essay Workshop.COURSE DESCRIPTIONDuring her lifetime, Octavia Butler wrote a dozen novels, won two Hugo and two Nebula Awards, and was the first ever science fiction writer to be awarded a MacArthur &#34;genius&#34; grant. Her novels feature vampires, time travel, alien/human dna swapping, and psionic combat; they also explore issues that continue to haunt us: race, class, sexuality, trauma, power and privilege, climate change, our history, our future, and what that pesky &#34;our&#34; implies. In this class, we&#39;ll read her stories and novels, critical and scholarly work about Butler and genre fiction in general, exploring both the contexts of her work and her influence up to this day."

While theory is often accused of being hopelessly esoteric - and, to some, overly academic and elitist - it offers a variety of perspectives, reflections, and ruminations on why writing and literature matter. This course will explore major concepts in literary theory and ask big questions about literature&#39;s role in society. Does a work of literature have a stable meaning? Can literature challenge social norms? Are stories universal? We will discuss texts from a variety of time periods and cultures, including readings in cultural studies, Marxism, psychoanalysis, structuralism/post-structuralism, feminism, race studies, post-colonial studies, gender studies, queer theory, and all the &#34;post-&#34; derivations of these areas. Along with the theoretical works, we will look at a few literary texts and discuss how theory can shape what we do as readers and, especially, as writers."

Do you know who inspired them? In this class, students will research, read and discuss the inspirations of prominent writers, artists, and makers in order to understand their processes, choices, challenges and accomplishments. Additionally, we will explore how writers, artists, designers, and architects are influenced by the communities from which they come and the communities they create together by founding presses, collectives, and schools. Our readings can range from academic essays and speeches to blog posts, video interviews and podcasts. As a class, we will build a reading list/bibliography tailored to our influences. Students will choose and pursue their own influence, write an abstract, create a bibliography, generate drafts, and create a digital project through the workshop process with the class. This course is especially useful to students who are working on artists&#39; statements or thesis projects, or seeking to pursue research on their own inspirations and influences. Students will read longer critical works on a range of topics to prepare to write and workshop a substantive digital research project of their own. This is an introduction to research techniques and study of various approaches and applications of critical methodology as it relates to interpretation and evaluation of texts. 2 This class will be structured in a hybrid workshop, and will vary week to week. We will read and discuss content that explores the theme of influences and its impact on art, literature and culture. We will have regular library labs to learn different research techniques and multimodal approaches to articulating our projects. The labs will often be self-directed, meaning you are expected to work on your research project. If I find that lab time is not productive for students, we will restructure."
